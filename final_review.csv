B0000SX2UC,Dual-Band / Tri-Mode Sprint PCS Phone w/ Voice Activated Dialing & Bright White Backlit Screen,PCS Phone,Luke Wyatt,Text Messaging Doesn't Work,"Due to a software issue between Nokia and Sprint this phone's text messaging capabilities don't work with Sprint's system and won't until a software patch comes out ""some time in the next few months"". You will have to spend at least 1 hour with Sprint's award winning customer service team to find someone who will admit this to you. The problem is that Nokia designed their phones so that incoming messages are retrieved quickly and then viewed ""offline"" the way most providers work. Sprint, however, likes to have people hook up to their server first and then stay connected, burning minutes while they check their inbox, compose a reply and wait for the Sprint server to respond so they can send it out.

I also purchased this phone after my samsung A460 died. The menu is easily comprehendable and speed dialing is available for around 300 numbers. Voice dialing is also a nice feature, but it takes longer than speed dialing. The only thing that bothers me is the games...Nokia seems to have taken snake (1 and 2) off their phones. There is a skydiving game, bowling, and tennis (like pong). The ringers are very nice, and a feature is available to choose a different ringer for each person calling. However, ringtones are not available online to download to this phone. You're pretty much stuck with what you have. There are vibrating ringtones and regular (midi) polyphonic tones.

You can take the case off to put your own pictures in the jaket which is super cool, but when i took it back to the store-an employee said they were meant to be hard to get off. Well, he could barely even get it off- he came close to snapping the casing in half. I was never able to get it off after that which isnt THAT big of a deal, but it got dirty under the clear casing and it looks really dirty now. MAKE SURE YOU CAN GET YOUR CASE ON AND OFF!

B0000SX2UC,Dual-Band / Tri-Mode Sprint PCS Phone w/ Voice Activated Dialing & Bright White Backlit Screen,PCS Phone,habblie,"works great, but don't dropt it","I've had this phone for over a year and I really like it. Having never been partial to flip phones, I can appreciate this Nokia's features. The color screen is very nice and all of the features are easy to use. The keylock is a simple two-button sequence though I do wish it had a timer for the keylock like my old phone. It has a lot of useful features, like a calculator, organizer, stopwatch and alarm, but the three games it has are too lame to play. The customizable features are nice, but lacking in variety. This isn't the ideal phone for a guy. You're few options are pretty girly. The ringtones also lack something to be desired, but there are a few decent ones. The battery life is pretty good, nothing special, but definitely not bad. It gets me through the average day without problems and sometimes lasts for several days. My parents, sisters, and husband all got fancy Samsung flip phones with cameras and all the toys, and I must say mine works better. The battery lasts MUCH longer and the recpetion is MUCH better. The downside to this cute phone is the case. It's made of very weak plastic that cracked in a few months. Also, if you're thinking about getting a different case for it, DON'T! Once you take it off, it will keep slipping off. It never attaches firmly again, and neither does the new case you bought. I've read this in other reviews too. Because of this, the last time I dropped it the back piece popped off and the battery flew out. Now my phone has issues. Drat. Overall, it's a great phone, if you're content with the simpler things in life. Who really uses the camera on thier phone anyway? I just reccommend buying a protective case for it and leaving it on and don't drop the delicate thing.",0.1530001755001754
B0000SX2UC,Dual-Band / Tri-Mode Sprint PCS Phone w/ Voice Activated Dialing & Bright White Backlit Screen,PCS Phone,Zachary O. Toups,"Slow, annoying, fragile, heavy, and bulky...","1.) Slow - If you want to check your missed calls list, this phone feels compelled to inform you whether or not there are any new calls in the list...it does this for about 20 seconds. Of course, it will take you half a second to read the message...and you probably don't care about what it says. 2.) Annoying - Ever had anyone scream in your ear? That's a sensation I get from this phone on a regular basis. It has the nice ability to attach a voice tag to a phone number...a useful feature...when it works. About 80% of the time, it recognizes the number I ask for, the other 20% it lets me know that it doesn't understand...by screeching (next to my head). Want to know what that feels like with your phone? Turn the ringer up to the highest setting, hold the phone next to your ear, call your phone. Not pleasant. Add to this the fact that when you're searching one of the numerous menus on the phone (menus that have at least 5 items in them), the menu system uses up a whole screen to display one line of text. It has three lines available to it...but it uses one. What's next? What did you just pass? Go back and look, can't find out another way! 3.) Fragile - My phone is cracked. Why you ask? Because I took off the battery cover. Why did you take off the battery cover you ask? Because I wanted to write this review and that was the only way to find out the model number. 4.) Heavy - Speaks for itself...the phone weighs way too much. 5.) Bulky - Again, like heavy, speaks for itself. My recommendation: buy a better phone. This one will only make you cry at night.",-0.0048787878787878
B0000SX2UC,Dual-Band / Tri-Mode Sprint PCS Phone w/ Voice Activated Dialing & Bright White Backlit Screen,PCS Phone,esti,Worth paying more for something else.,"I bought this phone about a year ago and have been using it ever since, on the Sprint PCS network, to replace an old TP2100. The first time I bought it, the phone was defective, so I had to get it replaced after a few days. I liked the phone okay at first, but I really wish I can go back in time and buy a better phone. Several issues: *mediocre reception. *rather bulky and unattractive. *cheap feel, cheaply made, cheap materials. *screen not easily visible in bright sunlight. *battery life marginal. I will go into a little detail about a few things. I get okay reception on this phone. It is NOT GOOD reception. The phone will work in areas where there is a good signal, but in areas with a marginal signal, such as my apartment, the phone will drop calls left and right, and fade in and out about 5 seconds of every minute (this is outside, so interference from the building is not the cause). In my residence, I use my husband's Sanyo, as it gets an excellent signal, and doesn't drop nearly as many calls. I have had Sprint check out the phone, and they say it is working correctly. I can only assume it is the poor quality of the phone that is to blame. The phone is quite big for what I would expect from a modern phone, with no camera. In a small purse, it takes up a lot of room. What is more important is that the phone is cheaply made, and has a cheap feel to it. It's made out of rather flimsy plastic. I dropped the phone once onto concrete from about 3 feet up, and the antenna head got a crack in it and a corner of the phone got serious scratches. Also, the screen can be difficult to read in bright sunlight, but it's quite bright otherwise. As far as battery life goes, it's not that great. I've gone to bed with the battery half full and have woken up to a dead phone. I believe the poor reception in my immediate area is to blame, as the phone searches for a signal and that takes battery time. Talk time is decent. Pros: *LOUD ringer *lots of features, but I rarely use them.",0.1729642857142857
B0000SX2UC,Dual-Band / Tri-Mode Sprint PCS Phone w/ Voice Activated Dialing & Bright White Backlit Screen,PCS Phone,brittho,Great free phone for Sprint customers.,This is an excellent choice for Sprint to use when enrolling new customers for service. It is the free option for most new customers and it has been excellent after a year of ownership. I love how it lights up when someone is calling which helps to really find the phone quickly when you are in the dark. If you have the phone in a purse it really makes it easy to find due to this fact. The Nokia phone seems to be tougher to me than the Samsung phones at the Sprint store also. So my only issue with the phone is the fact that since it is not a flip phone the keypad must be locked before I drop the phone in my pants pocket. This can be annoying if you get used to owning a flip phone before moving to the Nokia.,0.250959595959596

B0009N5L7K,Motorola I265 phone,Motorola,L. Hughes,WARNING,"My problems with nextel did not stop when I canceled my service. I will get to the problems with the service. When I went to get a new phone a day before my contract expired, I of course wanted to keep my number. So as I went to get my Cingular phone (highly recommended), I had the old number switched to my new number. Today, I get in the mail my nextel statement for the month with a $200 early termination even though I had not canceled my service, but had simply got a new phone and switched my number over. This was on icing on the cake after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextel. In my town, not a small town by any means, there are very few places that have any service. In the largest subdivision, you cannot get service anywhere. I constantly get comments from people trying to reach me that get the classic nextel line...Please hold while the nextel subscriber you are trying to reach is located. Most of the time I would not even recieve incoming calls, calls would go straight to my voice mail. Not only would I not get the calls, but often I would not even get the voice mails until days or even weeks later. When I did actually take calls (and call out), I cannot count the number of times I've had my call dropped. I recieved so many different error messages sometimes I wonder if they just spend all their time at nextel thinking of different error messages to program into their phones. That brings me to the selling point of nextel, the famed and well-loved direct connect feature. This is an absolute joke. Direct connect only works MAYBE half the time I tried to use it. Even then, in the middle of the conversation I would be greeted by the loud beep of my phone telling me I wont be talking to that person anymore. Of course, I would expect nothing less from the nextel network. Text messaging with nextel is next to impossible. If it did not take hours to send or recieve a message, it took days, or maybe didn't even come at all. The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked. Of course, when you don't have service, you don't get the internet access either. I was constantly getting the message ""network not available"". Calling and trying to complain to nextel is futile. Trying to get through to customer service takes forever and once you get through they do nothing. My experience with nextel has been nothing short of a disaster and I write this trying to warn anyone considering nextel. Stick with Verizon or Cingular and you will be much happier in the end. Don't make the same mistake I did.",0.0451953748006379

As I expected, all I had to do was put the old SIM card in the new phone and it worked. There are two serious drawbacks to this device, both related to the candy bar style. First, all the buttons are exposed, so it's easy to hit one accidentally. Second, the screen is easily scratched. This one got scratched making it difficult to read in sunlight. Aside from those two flaws, the phone works great. Connectivity, battery life, and quality of voice are superb. Since I don't do texting I can't comment on that.

I bought this phone at least 3 (maybe 4) years ago, after two ""fancy"" (expensive) flip phones each lasted less than a year before falling apart. My goal was not to buy a phone that would last 4 years (I didn't expect any phone would) and certainly was not to buy a $20 phone that would last 4 years. My goal was just not to spend $150 on another phone. I hoped it might last 6 months, until I decided what to do next (change service providers, get a new contract with a free phone, etc.) To my surprise, this little brick of a phone just keeps going. It has not been treated lightly (I recently opened up the back to find the serial #, and found it full of dirt & dust). It has crashed with me skiing, been splashed with salt water while sailing, and been drenched in sweat while in my bike jersey. Still, it works. Complaints: I dearly wish it had a camera, even a crappy one. Sometimes the exposed buttons get pressed accidentally. It has no fancy features. But I'm going to buy another one-- just in case this one ever quits. UPDATE 1/1/12: This phone is still going. 5+ years now. I bought this phone when the first-generation iPhone came out.

Also, I attest to the main review that this phone is a ""TERMINATOR"" phone, meaning it is EXTREMELY resistant to almost all forms of physical harm. I have never tried soaking it in water, but I have dropped it, thrown it, scraped it, kicked it etc. and the screen and battery are still perfectly functional. Great battery life as well.

As for the person whose wife's phone was dead, it probably was jostled in her purse and was inadvertently turned on. I prefer bar phones to any other kind (not sure why), and one of the first things I learned was to lock the keypad whenever I put it in my purse, in my pocket, or any other place where it would be possible for the phone to be accidentally turned on.

I didnt want to spend another 100+ on a phone that wil just break, then i stumbled upon these gophones, they are from 19.99-99.99 at best buy and work perfectly with my AT&T monthly subscription SIM card, so its just a crazy cheap phone. The battery life is AMAZING, its rated 9 hours, when i first bought it i opened it in the store and turned it on, it had 1 bar. It wasnt for another 3 hours untill i got home to charge it, and it still had the same 1 bar of battery life. I also talked a good 25 minutes too. VERY durable, i love the battery back, its not one of those slide ones (like some Sony phones), and its not one where you just push a button (like the RAZR). its a combination, you press the butten and then slide, it works REALLY WELL so there is very little chance you will break/lose the cover. came preloaded with 3 games for me, this cool space invader style game, a soccer game, and this weird mole game that is my personal favorite. Came with a TON of actually decent tones you can set as your ringtone.. unlike the RAZR which came with a horrid selection. it also came with an unactivated brand new sim card. so if your like me and you just bought this phone so you can put your old sim card into it, you will get a bonus sim card that you can sell on craigslist for like 10-15 dollars, seeing that it came with one of the new 3G cards. my only real complaint is that the keypad is really cramped, but its still easily usable, but you still get the feeling that its cramped, and my phone only came with 3 preloaded images to set as my wallpaper, and at times the call quality is a little shakey, but it rarely happens and when it does it goes away very fast... but for 30 dollars! thats a fraction of a price than the cheapest upgrade service plan phone. ---- I really doubt anybody will actually read this edit, but it is definitely worth a mention. I have had this phone since august (its Feb. 11). I hope dropped it countless times, this phone WILL NOT BREAK. Seriously, I've tried. I take horible care of this phone. I wanted to test its durability (and show off to my friends that my 20 dollar phone is more durable than your 5,000,000,000 dollar one) As demonstrations I've thrown it at trees, walls, concrete sidewalk, I've thrown it in the snow... hell I've even tossed it on the concrete and invited my friends to join me in a game of soccer with it. No joke. I didn't just do this once, but several, several times. The worst that has happened to it is the battery-cover snapped off and the battery fell out, all I had to do was put the battery back in, snap on the cover and turn the phone on. After about 4 months of treating it like that I did the same thing, actually just today (Feb. 11th). I chucked it at the concrete ground, the battery/battery cover flew off (as usual) but to my surprise when I turned it on I had a small black bar through the screen, but even more surprising is that it still works perfectly, everything does. It amazes me how poorly I've taken care of this phone, if I had done even 1/16th of the things I did to this phone to my old RAZR I can assure you it would have snapped in half or something. I highly recommend this phone. I'm going to buy another one soon, heck I might even pick up 2 one for an emergency replacement.",0.0906863897596656
B000SKTZ0S,MOTOROLA C168i AT&T CINGULAR PREPAID GOPHONE CELL PHONE,Motorola,Love Gadgets,Great disposible phone?,"I got this phone based on a recommendation from AT&T :( silly me. I wanted a back up phone my wife could use in case her other phone failed to turn on (also a motorola different model almost 5x price). They recommend this phone because of it's low cost and it's a go phone so you only pay for minutes you use. I bought the phone and loved it. It was very low cost, came with airtime. It feels very solid, except for the battery cover which seems flimsy but seems to hold up with no problems. It had what I felt as good sound quality and a good number of features for such a low cost phone. I wanted to prep the battery since my wife was going to travel soon, so I left it powered on and would constantly press a button so the light would stay on and drain the battery. The display is amazingly bright, I could almost use it as a flashlight. I was also really surprised at the battery life. Anyhow after two cycles of draining the battery and then charging it to full, I figured it would be all set to use as an emergency phone for my wife who was going on a two week business trip. Wrong :( on the last day of her trip her main cell phone battery was low so she decided to try to use the back up phone. It wouldn't turn on :( I don't know if it was due to the xray machines at the airports or what but the battery was drained. She said she never turned it on at all until that day so maybe it got turned on accidently in her purse (phone turns on by pressing a button on the front for 4 or 5 seconds). Anyhow to make matters worse the AT&T rep also said I could also use it as a main phone by transfering the SIM. Nope didn't work either, I was on the older AT&T plan so I had to be migrated. Atleast the phone didn't cost too much. I figure I can still keep it as an emergency 911 phone too (Go phone minutes expire :( which the AT&T rep didn't tell me about). And it does look pretty good as a paper weight.",0.0148648648648648

I had a hole in my pocket and it went tumbling down a flight of concrete steps (20 steps). It had a few scratches but it worked fine. It also made a few other death - defying leaps. It is VERY drop resistant. That being said, it is not crush proof. It's battery was just about dead so I decided to leave it in the car to charge. I plugged it into the car charger, grabbed my purse, and got out of the car. Unbeknownst to me, the charger cord was tangled around my purse. I stood up and closed the car door - right on this phone. That left a BIG mark - that finally did it in (If it still worked, I would have had the world's first boomerang phone - it looked just like a boomerang afterwards). I just ordered a new one. As much as I beat up my last phone and as well as it fared, I had to get another one. My only pet peeve with this phone is they could have at least given me ONE full game - not the lame demos that are included with it. The phone itself is about the size of a Hershey bar.

B001AO4OUC,Motorola i335 Cell Phone Boost Mobile,Motorola,Yoda,For a basic phone quite good,"For someone needing a very basic phone and services (i.e., no email access, no camera, etc.) this phone is quite good. The sound quality on both the built in speaker and mic and the speaker phone are very good, the phone itself is very portable and it has buttons one does not have to be a midget to operate. On the negative side (and why I give it 4 instead of 5 stars), it has a relatively small battery for its size, as anyone who has opened but back to install can attest. Hence the battery power for such a basic phone is not on a par with other ""basic"" phones, though not by much. A second critique is the very small screen which is, in addition, not very well lit. It can be a problem viewing, even in the shade. A third problem is that the interface for some of the features (i.e., voice recorder, contact list) is not as easy as it should be. Thanks to the small screen, one needs to scroll quite a bit to access some of the phone's features. One last critique is that the messaging service is quite slow. Hence if you need to use such a feature this phone is far from optimal. All and all a very good phone despite the weaknesses cited above.

B001AO4OUC,Motorola i335 Cell Phone Boost Mobile,Motorola,MayaMan,Terrible Customer Service,"I am a professional who recently purchased a Sanyo Juno phone to use as an extra special-purpose business phone. After using Boost cards to pay for the phone for two months I switched to the Auto Re-Boost Payment Service, wherein payments are automatically charged to my credit card each month. What a terrible mistake. Boost Mobile has been making monthly charges to my credit card at the same time that it has cut off my phone service, telling me that there is no money in my account. Of course, the latter cannot be true is the former is true. When I call Boost's service number to resolve the problem I learn that there are no human beings to speak to, only an automated list of options, none of which correspond to my problem. When I contact Boost via its online customer service (an e-mail option in which the customer is asked to describe his or her problem) I receive a phone call instructing me to call the service number, which, as I've just noted, provides no human operator and tells me that there is no money in my account. In other words, Boost Mobile tells me that to restore my service I must make another payment, even though that payment has already been made by their Auto Re-Boost plan. In effect, I must pay twice for each month of service and there is nothing I can do about it. Is this a company you would want to do business with?

Long: My old phone's LCD croaked on me, and I wanted to wait a bit before buying an HTC Dream, so I went with this cheap phone. Complaints: Menu/key response is sometimes slow. No way to get data to phone via USB cable, at least if you live in the US. It seems like a USB cable exists (in Europe, Asia and Australia) but it costs about as much as the phone itself does after exchange rates. If you go to [...], they talk about cable CA-126, which works with the 1680. It has a regular usb connector on one end, and a Nokia microusb & 2.5mm charger plug on the other. The US Nokia manual says the Microusb port is for ""authorized personal only"", which to my mind says that the carriers in the US wanted to force people into getting things onto the phone via some $$$-chargeable method. In any event, I'll be getting a new phone in a few months so I'll live with this phone for now.

This phone is a good value. It rings loud & clear, and the speakerphone is easy to hear. People I'm calling say my voice is clear, though they can tell I'm on a cell phone. It has a lot of neat software features; for example, you can configure a shortcut action for the left and right softkeys, as well the Up-Down-Left-Right buttons. There is no dedicated rocker switch on the side for volume up & down; during a call, the volume is adjusted by the Left and Right buttons. The phone is constructed well, but feels too light. Battery life is very good. The screen is bright and clear. Navigating menus can be a little sluggish. The keypad is stiff, making text messaging a chore. No Bluetooth connectivity, so forget about using one of those fancy headsets. The box does include a wired earbud/microphone with integrated call answer/end button. Something that annoyed me was how it saved numbers to the address book from an incoming call; the Nokia software puts a ""+"" symbol in front of incoming call numbers. That gets saved to the address book -- for example ""+15551212121"" -- a minor thing, and something probably more useful for European phone numbers, for example.

As far as ease of use for the keyboard...I havent had any problems and I have large hands/fingers. It takes a little getting used to but once acclimated you should have no problems. I cant comment on voice recognition or blue tooth as I dont really use those features and honestly find them useless (once in a while I'll use my ear piece in the car but its rare).

Brennan,I like it but a few shortcomings are significant enough that I wouldn't buy it again if I lost it.,"Good overall phone, bluetooth so far syncs well with the integrated bluetooth in a Mercedes that I used to have and also with the aftermarket Alpine stereo that I have in my VW. But some of the features and design are just poor and/or not thought out. Looks great but the body is far too slippery. It's like handling a bar of soap. I use it as my primary alarm clock in the morning and it's really clumsy to grab off the nightstand and shut off the alarm. Even when I'm fully awake and alert :-) it's hard to open and I've dropped it a few times while fumbling to open it. There is a wider slit on the clamshell lid to fit your finger into when opening in portrait mode but in landscape mode there's no place to insert your finger to flip it open, so you have to use your fingernail. Unlike my previous phone, it takes two hands almost all the time to open this thing whereas my old phone I could easily flip it open with one hand. I wish the alarm clock's snooze function was like most clock radios where it allows 10 minutes snooze time, not 5. 5 is just too short. Or, the phone should allow you to set the snooze period as a preference. There is no way to display the time on the front screen when the phone is dark; you have to open it up. Well, you can fake it by holding the lock button for the music keys, which will light up the display) but then you have to hold it a second time to reset the lock/unlock back to where you had it. Also, when you're on a call (although just about every cell phone fails on this) the clock doesn't display anywhere (so this is no better than other phones). How many times have you been on a call and said ""Hey let's meet later!"" and the person asks you ""Ok, what time is it now?"" and you can't tell. (I quit wearing watches because of the clocks on cell phones...but why don't they display the time when on a call?) The keys on the outside aren't too bad except the volume up/down is a little too easy to accidentally press. I like the keyboard idea overall but I find it's like typing on little Chiclet gum candies. I need to use my fingernails to avoid fat-fingering it. In QWERTY mode, the END button is too close to the space bar and I have inadvertantly killed my web browser when typing a space in a field on a page. Frustrating! With the END key was farther away. Wish they would have also engineered in some page up/down keys too, as scrolling line by line is cumbersome. I would also like the END and SEND keys to somehow be the traditional red and green colors too. I use Outlook on my netbook to ""sync"" (sort of) my contacts to the phone. This works alright but if you want to refresh your contacts you have to delete them all from the phone and then resend them over or they'll be duplicates. This is a bit annoying only in that you will then need to re-enter the ICE contacts manually. The bluetooth can send pics to my netbook, but only one at a time (cumbersome). Can't select multiple photos at once. Won't send videos at all to my netbook via Bluetooth. Have to send them via a picture message to email and fake it that way but you incur data usage charges doing it that way. Or you can use removable storage on the MicroSD card to do it. The biggest disappointment is the calendar. What a useless piece of junk! It says you can send calendar appointments to the phone, which you can, but it is half-baked. If you set a reminder in Outlook, the reminder doesn't carry over to the phone. The phone only supports one text field for the appointment and it corresponds to the Outlook appointment body (not the header meeting description nor location), so I have to retype the description and location in the Outlook calendar body if I want to see anything useful on the phone. Even then, some appointments come over with an empty text field on the phone (it is either a problem with the text being too long and/or having a carriage return in the text I think). So if I try to then enter it on the phone (enter the description in the displayed (and empty) text field), the phone freezes and then reboots. Terrible! The recurring meeting also is miserably half-baked. You cannot set an interval like ""every other week"". I work a 9/80 work schedule and I want to have every other Friday that I work in my phone so I know when I'm off work or not. I can only choose daily, weekly, monthly, or annually. So while it does take Outlook calendar items, they end up so flawed and useless that if you really do plan on using this phone as an organizer, don't; it will fail to meet your needs. I understand that Samsung uses this same calendar in many of its products and if so, it will be a deal breaker next time around for me and I'll shop a different brand. The add-on Mobile Email from OZ isn't too bad but it also has room for improvement. It is billed as ""fully integrated"" but not in my eyes. While the phone itself has a limited file viewer for certain file types stored on it, if you receive an email with attachments (even if just a .jpg), the OZ mobile email doesn't support accessing attachments. This is not what I call ""fully integrated"". The OZ email client also works a bit inconsistently (although maybe it's an issue with the email providers and not OZ?). With my Cox POP3 accounts, I can only access the inbox (not sent items). With Yahoo and Hotmail, I can access the various folders OK. With my university's email account (hosted by Google GMAIL), it displays both the inbox and the sent items in the inbox (really weird, and I imagine if I had other folders it might lump everything togeter as well). The user interface for the OZ mobile email isn't too bad although it was a bit unintuitive to find how to add a recipient to an email from the phone's contacts. Can be done but just was hard to find. Also isn't clear on how to add multiple recipients (use a comma or semicolon between them? don't know...) Beware of Verizon's compusory data plan with this phone. It is misleading. Supposedly for $9.99 a month you get 25MB of data usage. This often isn't presented clearly. It applies only to the web browser. Texting and picture messaging are not part of this 25MB **even though they use a data connection!**. It should be called a ""web browsing plan"", not a ""data plan"". So unless you pay for an additional texting plan, you will be charged for each message. I was pretty furious when my first bill arrived to find I was charged for the picture messages I sent thinking it was part of my ""data plan"". The mp3 player is alright although once or twice it froze up on me and I had to restart the phone. The headphone jack is a nontypical 2.5mm so you will need an adapter to go to 3.5mm. Booooo. Battery life is so-so. If at work I listen to mp3s during the day and also do a little lunchtime web browsing for about 10-15 minutes, I can easily go from a full battery to dead in about 5-6 hours. I don't know if this is typical or not of most phones, but it'd be nice if the mp3s can make it through one whole workday, but it can't. Sound on the built-in speakers is decent for something so small.",-0.0368145743145743
B0029F2O3A,"Samsung Alias2 U750 Phone, Black (Verizon Wireless)	",	Samsung,D. Kashmiri,Not an upgrade over original Alias,"I loved my Samsung Alias, as most Alias owners do. I decided to purchase the Alias 2 on faith, assuming that Samsung had simply updated certain features of the original. I was mistaken. The first thing you will notice is the size; the alias 2 is taller, thicker, and wider than the original. If you are like me, one of the reasons you bought the original alias was it's super-slim design. I would say it's about 50% bulkier than the original. While the original slid into your jeans and disappeared, the new one will stick out like a sore thumb. I suppose the increase in size supports the new and improved camera/camcorder but I never used that feature too much in the first place. Ultimately, I would say this is the reason I returned the alias 2, but I also did not care for the much ballyhooed liquid ink screen. When texting, you must toggle through 3 screens to find all the numbers/symbols/punctuation marks that you need. In fact, the third screen only had a scant number of symbols on it, so the empty space is frustrating when toggling to the first screen for the letters. The empty space is a theme on all screens in fact, in either orientation. As I said, I found this annoying (maybe only because I became so used to the 1000 figures/symbols crammed onto the original alias phone pad). I ended up returning the alias 2 and going back to the original. I will keep my new every 2 discount until Verizon comes out with a very good Android or Apple finally relents with the iphone/At&T exclusivity.",0.1702792207792208
B0029F2O3A,"Samsung Alias2 U750 Phone, Black (Verizon Wireless)	",	Samsung,Meg M.,Good Phone that could use a few tweaks,"I've gone through several phones in the last few years - whenever my rebates would apply I would upgrade. Last year I settled on the Alias 2, mostly because of the e-ink technology. I was impressed at first but the excitement of the new phone wore off as it always does. Regardless, it remains a trustworthy phone. Hopefully Samsung's newer versions of the Alias will fix a few flaws that I've run into, not the least of which is a slow system. When you're in the middle of typing a text and a new text comes in, the phone freezes momentarily before saving the text-in-progress in a draft and showing you the new text. The fact that the phone saves the text is good - but it would be better if the incoming text flew to the background and the phone allowed you to continue your typing. I've had to learn that when I'm typing a text and the phone stops registering what I'm trying to enter, I have to stop pushing buttons. If you give it a second, it'll resume normal running - otherwise, you might accidentally delete the incoming text. The same goes for trying to take a picture while a text comes in - except the picture doesn't save. Occasionally the phone gets confused - if you flip from landscape to vertical positions too fast, the keys and screen don't change, even after you push a few buttons. It continues to operate as if it were in vertical mode, even though the phone is flipped to the normal position. I like that I can switch from vertical to horizontal and back while in the middle of a text, but this only works if you flip fast enough (there's plenty of time - plus if you close the phone and don't flip fast enough, it simply saves your draft) and doesn't apply to any application other than an in-progress text. There's a decent signal with the Alias 2 - my previous phone was a cheap-o so I noticed an improvement in the signal but I can't verify that it's better than the enV or Omnia or other higher-end phone. If you're considering this phone, take into consideration that none of the cases, including the slimmest clear plastic ones, fit very well on the dual-hinge. They don't prevent the phone from opening, but they do cause a strain on the hinge when flipped in landscape mode and they make phone bulkier than necessary. In terms of size, it has a great feel. It's probably a little bit taller than most phones (about the size of the enV Touch and the orignal enV) but it's very slim and definitely pocket-sized. The keyboard, both in landscape and vertical modes, is a great size and perfect for texting. The keys have a unique feel and are not too big and not too small. The front display provides access to your music and taking a picture self-portrait style. (I've seen some complaints that this isn't possible - it is, you have to hold down the play/pause button then the skip-back button to activate the camera. You can see a preview of the picture and simply press the play/pause button again to take the pic.) The front display also allows you to see text message previews and a quick response with the ""Quick texts"" ... You have to have ""Auto-display text"" options set - a feature I didn't discover until I'd had the phone for six or seven months. (Probably should have read the manual!) The volume for the speaker and the mic are good - I haven't had trouble with not being able to hear anyone or with them hearing me. The speaker phone can be a bit crackly if it's up all the way, but full volume is not necessary as it is plenty loud. When the phone is closed, i.e. listening to music - it needs to be up a bit louder and therefore is sometimes crackly but I'm satifisied with it. After all, it's phone, not a iPod dock. All-in-all, this is a great phone with just a few minor problems. I'm still happy with it after the initial novelty has worn off, even though I'm lusting after an enV Touch (just my personal fickleness when it comes to phones!) I'm saving my money, however, and holding onto the trusty Alias 2.",0.1469715268628312

The phone user interface isn't simple, and is made somewhat more complicated because they keyboard layout is constantly changing based on what screen you're on. For example, there's an awkward key layout in some versions of the layout, takes too many keystrokes to do things like turn off an alarm (I guess I've been spoiled by almost always owning Nokias, as they tend to have the best-designed user interfaces). Aside from the clumsy UI, the biggest thing that killed this for our family was its inability to sync contacts and calendar events with Outlook. Maybe there's a way to do it with a combination of MyVerizon and USB cables, but its not worth the effort, especially when I can switch to a Nokia that takes care of it (as an aside, I switched to AT&T a week later because of the poor phone selection at Verizon. Also, Verizon disables any Bluetooth syncing capabilities with Outlook, even for the few Nokias they offer.)

After all, it contains the E Ink powered keyboard technology where keys can transform from vertical to horizontal and from regular to QWERTY keyboard at the touch of a button and using the dual-flip style that makes this phone more than just the typical flip phone. The first release had its faults, which is why Samsung and Verizon have released the Alias 2. The phone has its improvements. The best one is the fact that, when flipped open sideways, you get enough room to navigate and type with the QWERTY keyboard. The keys are not as crammed in together as the first Alias, for more comfortable typing. The phone also contains GPS, VCast Music with Rhapsody, web e-mail , IM capabilities and a mobile web browser. You can use these features with Verizon's fast EV-DO/3 G network. The phone also has a user-friendly menu and beautiful internal and external display. It's got 80 MB of internal memory (memory expandable to 16 GB with a media card) and a 2 MP camera with some nice, though limited video-recording capabilities. The Alias 2, though an improvement from the original Alias, has its downsides. For one thing, it looks outdated. At a mere glance, it looks like a typical flip phone that's been out for years. It only comes in one color (grayish black), and there's nothing about it that makes it attractive or unique at first glance. The keys are difficult to press. I had to press the keys rather hard every time I used the QWERTY keyboard. My thumbs ached after a while. The OS is quirky. It froze on me quite a few times and I had to do a force reboot. Very annoying when you're in the middle of sending a text message or checking your e-mail. And that's another thing, the calling, or lack thereof. I had about three dropped calls in one day. That's a lot for a phone, especially when I had most if not all network bars. What gives? And last but not least, the phone contains the same old Verizon menu and looks. The only nice thing about it is that you can personalize the internal and external screens with some cute animated wallpaper or other. All in all, the Samsung Alias 2 has all the makings for a popular messaging/multimedia phone. However, I don't think it's quite ready for prime time yet. A slicker design would be nice as well as some improved features and smoother keys. If you're in the bargain for a messaging phone that's stylish as well as functional, and you're in the Verizon network, I strongly recommend the LG enV3 or the enV Touch. You cannot go wrong with those two phones. In the meantime, if you really want this phone, make sure you weigh in the pros and cons before you decide to commit to it for two long years.",0.1403679653679653

I need a basic phone, and want a few bells and whistles. I replaced a basic LG cell phone with the Alias2 on the recommendation of a friend. I immediately liked the heftier feel and the easier to read displays, though I swiftly changed the rather twee and hard to figure out menu page. Pros: I LOVE having dedicated keys for voicemail, bluetooth and voice menus. The rotating keypad is just too cool for words, and though I don't send many texts, I use the notepad all the time. The QWERTY keyboard is very easy to use, even with fingernails. It's nice to know I can check email and have internet access if necessary, though I probably never will. The camera is great, and I like the editing options for pictures. The screen size is generous and easy to see, especially in landscape mode. It's easy to use. Sound quality is good. Nice long life of battery charge. Cons: The default backgrounds, though those are easy enough to change. Some functions are difficult to find on the menus. That's how I found the voicemail key--couldn't find VM on a menu. The ring isn't loud enough to be heard when the phone is in a jacket pocket--but I've never found a phone with a loud enough ring. There's not a button on the outside that will light up the display--to check the time, you have to open the phone. (ETA: Yes, there is--it just takes a few seconds for the display to light. Duh.)

B002UHS0UI,Verizon Wireless Motorola RAZR V3m - Silver	,Motorola,George,Great option vs data plan phones,"These are great phones. My wife's old one had a broken screen, so I replaced this and my son's non RAZR phone. We had good experience with the RAZR, so we decided to get 2 this time. I ""upgraded"" both phones online without any issues. We have an old Verizon plan, didn't want to pay the required data plan for a new smart phone, and didn't like their current non-smart phones. I'm guessing that Verizon intentional had some bad non-smart phones so people would lean towards the more profitable smart phones and plans. We only use our phones for calls, so this was a great alternative to getting a Verizon store offered phone. I am a long time Verizon customer, but would have switched to another provider than pay for an unnecessary data plan if I had to. I am happy I can keep my old plan, and not have to switch to their newer plans. Note that Verizon customer support did not volunteer this upgrade option (buying replacement phone from non-Verizon store) until I asked them directly. I also could not get my GetItNow or BackupAssitant (contact auto-sync) to work on these legacy/unsupported Verizon phones. Not a show stopper for me since I printed (but wasted too much paper--wished they had a simple list view) the contacts that were already in the contacts online from my old, broken phone, and just manually copy/backup the numbers now. Also we (wife and I) don't use GetItNow (much). Too bad since I thought BackupAssistant was one of Verizon's better, more useful features, especially when upgrading phones. It was (and still is) annoying that they didn't upgrade their error messge when trying to run GetItNow/Get_New_App from ""Unable to retrieve catalog. Please try again later. (3332)"" to ""Legacy/unsupported phone. Don't waste your time to try again"". If I didn't see the reviews for this error, I think I would have wasted my time with Verizon support since I didn't see any positive feedback (good/simple solutions) yet. If they wanted to fix the issue, they would of had a good, simple resolution a few years ago, not just possibly getting support at a Verizion store, and possibly getting an unusable phone at the end. Again, my online ""upgrade/replacement"" of my phone was simple and straigtforward, and my phone calls are working fine. I wouldn't think Verison would make much money from supporting or if they still sold these old/legacy phones, so fixing/maintaining their sofware for them would be a very low priority (they wouldn't want say they give no support to their existing phones). At the end, I am still happy I could keep my old (non-data) plan, fix/replace my phone, even though I don't have BackupAssitant. Phone and phone call quality is still 5 stars. Verizon's GetItNow and BackupAssitant support of these legacy Verizon phones, 2 stars.",0.0916781799760523

B002UHS0UI,Verizon Wireless Motorola RAZR V3m - Silver	,Motorola,farmgirl,I feel duped,"I purchased this phone in hopes of replacing my old razr from Verizon. I was excited when I got this in the mail and the phone looked like official Verizon merchandise but I later learned that not all features were supported by the Verizon network even though this phone is advertised by the seller that it does. The first thing I noticed when I turned the phone on was that the software was different than my old one but I figured the phone may have older/newer software. I went to the Verizon store and they had a little trouble getting the phone activated but once it was up then it was ready to go but only a couple things...it constantly roams and it can not send nor recieve picture messages. I was on the phone with Verizon's tech support for over two hours but they were not able to help me so their suggestion was to go to a Verizon store. So, back to the Verizon store I went where I was told the software that was installed was through Altell...not Verizon. They said they would not be able to flash it to Verizon so that I could actually utilize all the features of the phone without frying the phone. I went to another Verizon store who did attempt to flash it but it did nothing. As the representative looked at the phone she noticed that the back plate which this seller boasted as a Verizon phone was just a little off which indicated that the Verizon back plate was not the original and there were some scuff marks on it...which also indicated that the phone was used..another disappointment since the one I ordered was advertised as new. I paid close to 80.00 for this phone because the seller indicated that it was indeed a Verizon phone and was supported by the Verizon network. $80.00 lesson learned and now I have a phone that I can't use except as a great paper weight and a powerful reminder there isn't always truth in advertising.",0.0744071146245059

Now my review: I paid $20 for a USED Moto Razr, and it was a screaming deal! The phone is slim, still styleish after all these years and works PERFECTLY!! Razr has always been a good phone. DON'T BE STUPID and follow the negitive reviews, these are from clueless consumers who really don't know much about electronics. They are rating the shipping time of the phone and that is NOT what these reviews are for. Deal with it. PHONE RATING: 5 STARS. Keep in mind- these are OLD ELECTRONIC DEVICES!

B002UHS0UI,Verizon Wireless Motorola RAZR V3m - Silver	,Motorola,Stephen,Old Faithful,"I'll first say what others have said on similar reviews--this is a review of the actual phone, not the seller or the carrier service. What can I say? This was my very first phone, and man was it a good one. I still have one as my backup phone. Even to this day, it is one of the most reliable products I have ever owned, and is far more reliable than almost every phone on the market today (rivaled only by the iPhone). The phone could hardly be any thinner and fits easily in any pocket. Its hinge is strong and durable; I never had it break or cease to function. The paint never chipped (except when I dropped it) or lost its color. The software (mine was Verizon software) is nothing special, but it does its job very well. It is easily navigable, making it simple to check text messages or phone records. It's not made for extended web sessions, but you can check your email on it just fine. The camera isn't the highest resolution out there, but it works as intended when you need a picture in a pinch. The keys feel great and are big enough for anyone to see. They can easily be texted on. The keypad on my RAZR did finally fall apart over time, but it lasted well over 2 years before doing so and the buttons still worked in spite of it. I'm rating this phone 5 stars because it accomplished what it set out to do; give the user a quality, reliable, and innovative (for its time) product that blasted the competition out of the water. It isn't for everyone; it has none of the smartphone ""flair"" or performance, but it gets the job of a phone and text message platform done extremely well. This phone was born in a world without smartphones, but even today in a world where smartphones dominate, the Motorola RAZR V3 hasn't lost its relevance or effectiveness--and I respect that a great deal.",0.2357583774250441

Stability issues within months,"Purchased used - this review is not about the phone in particular, but in the one received from the seller. Additionally, due to time constraints I did not attempt to take advantage of any guarantees. Purchased for my wife - she was sick of her smartphone and wanted to go back to the past. It came with a charger and a battery. The charger was aftermarket, and the connector was of very low quality - it broke within a week or so. Because Motorola back in the day tried to force you to use ""genuine"" chargers, I had to get a Motorola charger. Then the batter stopped holding a charge a week or so after that. I believe there was a guarantee, but we had to go on a trip and didn't have time to wait - so I grossly overpaid for a batter at batteries plus. Things were going ok, but eventually the 0 button stopped working reliably a few months later, then the phone starting locking up a month or so after than. Several factory resets and hours later it was stable again, but only temporarily... Pretty sure we got a lemon. It is now in the trash. Moral of the story is that if you have issues, be sure to get ahold of the seller right away.",0.0625283446712018
B002UHS0UI,Verizon Wireless Motorola RAZR V3m - Silver	,Motorola,MDB,Junk,I currently own an ALLTEL Motorola V3c. I love that phone and since Verizon disabled it I cannot use it. The V3c is nothing like the V3m. The battery needs to be on the charger at all times. This is the 2nd V3m I have purchased since my original phone was disabled and they are both junk. I will resign to the fact that this phone has NO extras and drains the battery continuously. I wish I could remove that star.,0.1791666666666667
B002UHS0UI,Verizon Wireless Motorola RAZR V3m - Silver	,Motorola,Roger Williams,Get It Now or Get It Not.. it's a gamble,"The phone that I received was rated as being in ""very good"" condition yet the entire Get It Now/Media Store function refused to work. This is a problem that Verizon Wireless is aware of and has no plans to do anything about it. Details can be found in my review here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CD4BYNT4DA46/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm (I'm not allowed to duplicate my own reviews.. even if it is for the same problem on essentially the same product). If downloads are important to you, beware because many older Verizon phones just can't do it anymore.. and the sellers don't seem to know anything about it. I sent four requests to four different sellers requesting information as to whether their phone's Get It Now/Media Store was removed and didn't get a single reply. I emailed the seller that I bought mine from, I was told that the phone was ""completely functional"" in spite of the fact that it was missing the Get It Now/Media Store (functionality that is contained in the description of the product). I was offered a refund but couldn't find a seller that would tell me if their phone worked or not.. so what's the point. Thanks a lot Verizon for breaking so many phones and thanks to the sellers that don't even know that the equipment they are selling doesn't work correctly (my seller didn't even have a Verizon account to test his phones with!). If you only make and receive calls and texts, this probably doesn't apply to you. If you want to use ANY of the phone's extended features (ringtones, music and video downloads or any application such as Navigator, Facebook, Backup Assistant, etc.), check with the seller to make sure the phone they're selling isn't suffering from the missing Get It Now/Media Store catalog problem.

I must have dropped it a gazillion times and it worked great for the first five or so years. I had to pray over it to get it to last the additional year. I really did pray over it. The screen finally gave out and I was no longer able to see anything, although I could still make and receive calls. If I put my SIM card in my other phone I could read my texts. After a month or so of that, I broke down and order this phone from Amazon. It was in good working condition, however, it was a Sprint phone (not mentioned in description by the seller) and I have T-Mobile. Luckily I bought a Samsung Exhibit, while I was waiting for the phone to arrive (I planned to give the Moto to my daughter). The Samsung is great, it was definitely time for me to upgrade, but there are some things that the 'ol Moto does that the fancy new Samsung doesn't. For example, the alarm will still go off on the Moto even when the phone is turned off. I liked that feature, because I like to turn my phone off a night to save battery, but know that my alarm will still wake me up in the morning.

B002UHS0UI,Verizon Wireless Motorola RAZR V3m - Silver	,Motorola,Roger Williams,VERIZON BUYERS BEWARE OF OLDER PHONES,"Through no fault of the resellers (and unbeknownst to most of them), many of the older Verizon phones MAY have their Get It Now/Media Store rendered unusable. This takes away the ability to download music, ringtones, videos and ANY applications (such as Backup Assistant, VZ Navigator, games, weather, maps, etc.) from Verizon. Back in late March, 2011, Verizon pushed an update to all their phones and any of the older phones that were not activated at the time lost the Get It Now/Media Store catalog with no way to retrieve it through future updates. Verizon will tell you that you can take it to a store to get it flashed to restore the Get It Now/Media Center catalog, but it seems that basically none of the stores have the ability to actually flash phones (there was a report of a store in South Carolina that could flash phones..). More information (including official input from Verizon employees) can be found on Verizon's support community forum site (search for ""Error Cannot retrieve catalog... (3328) Backup Asst..""). If you only use your phone to make calls and/or text, this information does not apply to you. If you DO use Get It Now/Media Store, you will probably want to check with the seller to make sure that the phone's Get It Now/Media Store works.. or you might end up with a Get It Not. NOTE TO READERS: My purchase and experience was with a Verizon V3m in pink. After numerous hours talking with Verizon's tech support and multiple emails, I was able to determine that the exact same problem was happening to many older Verizon phones (there were more than 50 models by LG, Motorola, Samsung, Nokia and others specifically listed in their forum). I am not affiliated with anyone. NOTE TO AMAZON: The material in this review is completely of my own composition and pertains to a number of Verizon phones.

The number of problems that I have had with it, 0. It has lived up to its claim of being a rugged phone. I take mine in wooded areas, industrial plant areas, and even under vehicles. I don't ever remember submerging it, but it has been in water soaked clothing on numerous occasions. Call quality has been good. I am now starting to notice some more breakup in calls as the phone has aged, but at this point it is hard to complain. My biggest complaint is that it does not stay connected with blue tooth headsets as well as I would like. It almost needs line of sight if you are just sitting idle. I have tried a couple of different headsets with the same results. Sending text messages is a little difficult without a keyboard but that is a given. The camera is average. It is good for quick shots but I grab a regular camera for anything I intend to print out.

B002WTC1NG,Motorola Barrage V860 Phone (Verizon Wireless)	,Motorola,sirlansa,Not very Rugged,"I bought this phone because my previous one kept falling out of my belt clip and getting scratched up. I figured I'd pay the extra money to get a Mil-spec phone and not have to worry about damage happening. I have a kayak and wanted to be able to take a phone out on the boat without worry about water getting in it. I also purchased a Verizon belt clip with holder that wraps around the phone. Well this first thing I found was that the belt clip kept coming off my belt and the phone kept landing on hard floors, etc. The second thing I know the outside screen (thin plastic) is cracked. Verizon wants a minimum of $189 to replace it with a used phone (unless I'd purchased insurance). Phone repair places can't get parts to repair it. Of course this eliminates the waterproofing feature, since water can likely get in the 2 cracks on the screen. I don't mind the cracks themselves since I don't really use the outside screen. Third happening was when the holder that wraps around the phone started coming off and letting the phone fall out. That's when I discarded the belt clip/holder and started carrying the phone in my pocket. I've decided I was actually better off with the old phone. I'd have had a lot more dollars in my pocket, since the Mil spec designation adds NOTHING! Other than that it's a pretty good phone. Just don't buy it for its ruggedness.",0.1232456140350877

You can actually use the phone's USB cable feature to upload music, ringtones, and contacts but neither the manual nor tech support will tell you how. Good luck figuring it out. It was a frustrating trial and error process. You can also find third party software to load your calendar for a lot less than $50 but Motorola and Verizon techs aren't allowed to direct you. If you're on a job site that uses the PUSH to TALK function, it might be worth putting up with this phone and provider but there are better options out there - phones that are more rugged and waterproof and will actually let your use the phone's features.

But Verizon made me purchase minutes? - Fixed, great phone!","It seems like the seller(s?) don't know the difference between the prepaid version of the phone and the standard contract version. Either that or Verizon is just full of idiots (entirely possible.) When I activated the phone online, with the aid of Verizon live chat service, it made me dial a number and then required me to purchase minutes. I have read other reviewers say that Verizon would not/could not activate their phone on the prepaid network. I'm not sure what's going on but I'm pretty irritated. I like the phone, alot for the use I've gotten out of it so far (very little), but the whole reason I ditched my smartphone was because I was sick of all the complicated BS. P.S. If anyone could help me figure out what's going on here I'd appreciate it. EDIT: Apparently me and Verizon were both being idiots. I have it active and working as it should now. The phone itself is wonderful. Since I still have a data plan I can get all kinds of cute little arcade games and apps. Simple things of course but I'm a simple lady. It's a pretty sturdy phone, it's lightweight and feels like it might be made of cheap material but it's designed in a way to take a fall. One reason smartphones break so easily is because they are square and flat. This thing is rounded on any angle. The 'closed' screen is flat but it is slightly inlayed in the phone so if you do drop it directly on that surface it will hit the plastic edges of the phone and not the screen. The backplate isn't sealing as tightly as it should, which probably does not make it waterproof ""up to 1 meter of water for 30 minutes"" but I think that might have been my fault by trying to improperly open the backplate. The keypad is silicone or something and has no gaps. With the backplate properly sealed I'm sure it is waterproof. Christmas came early lol I'm happy with this little guy. Oh and no more charging my phone twice a day. I haven't charged it since I got it a week ago and despite use in almost every possible way it didn't get down to one battery bar until today.

Good reception.","Motorola Barrage - MOTV860 UPDATE 6 MONTHS LATER: Alright, so maybe this isn't such a bad phone after all. It is VERY simple and it STILL gets great reception compared to other verizon phones I've had. I still wouldn't call it rugged at all. But, for a penny- I think it is the best bet of all the 1 cent options, as it is still working great after 6 months and the fact that it weighs nothing and doesn't seem to contain any glass or metal as advertised has become less annoying as it has been consistently performing well. No problems since the early exchange for the dud. Maybe they just need to change their advertising angle as it isn't bad at all, but is NOT industrial grade. Because of it's consistently very high talk quality and ease of use, I have upped it a star. ____________________________ UPDATE: two months later... Returned the original phone because the screen kept going blank. Had no problems at Verizon with the exchange because it had been purchased within 30 days and have had no problems with the replacement phone. The reception is still VERY good and the Battery life long. But still... it is not a rugged phone by any stretch. There is no such thing as an industrial grade phone. Please Motorola, start making something in the USA! ----------------------------- Maybe this was designed to military specs, but it is just a cheap plastic phone... toy even. I don't know where the metal and glass is on this consumer version of what may have once been an industrial grade design. The hinge doesn't seem to be metal, it seems to be plastic although it could be aluminum or some other inexpensive and light metal. The screen doesn't seem to be glass, but plastic. screen goes completely white randomly, rendering it useless a good deal of the time. Don't know that it would survive even a 2 foot drop, since it didn't seem to make it through shipping without getting messed up. The product description is a joke compared to what was actually delivered. Looking for a rugged phone? Don't look to the Barrage unless appearances are all that matters. This phone should be heavy, it weighs nothing and feels cheap. I don't know that a truly rugged phone exists anymore. If Motorola won't make a quality product in the USA, there's no one that will. The only thing positive about this phone is that it does seem to get rather good reception when the screen isn't white. If Motorola wants to tout this phone as rugged, they need to use the original design components or change the description from metal and glass to thin plastic, made in China. Bottom Line - Looks Tough, feels weak. Good Reception. Rugged? HA... All Hat, No Cattle.",0.0832857846760286

B002WTC1NG,Motorola Barrage V860 Phone (Verizon Wireless)	,Motorola,Lisa Kearns,"Rugged, long lasting, and perfect for people who don't do more than text and talk","I've owned this phone for nearly four years and I love it! I've dropped it and soaked it, and it still works perfectly. It has lots of nice features like a notebook function for jotting notes to yourself, a camera (although the photos aren't as crisp as with more hi-tech phones), alarm clock, calculator and stop watch. The original battery (from Verizon) didn't last more than a year, but replacements are inexpensive, and I adore this phone overall. I don't like touch screens, and don't text enough to need a full keyboard, so this phone is perfect. I have the Internet capability turned off, although it would be useful for looking up addresses while on the road. While my husband and kids have gone through two fancy phones each in the time I've owned this one (one dropped in the toilet, one shattered on the floor, one just died on its own, and one started typing random letters in texts) I've had the same bullet-proof phone.",0.3148148148148147

B002WTC1NG,Motorola Barrage V860 Phone (Verizon Wireless)	,Motorola,Mark W. Ingalls,Great VZW Phone for Active Adults,"I was in the market for a new phone, and I had the following list of desires: + Tetherable wireless modem. + Ruggedized + Uses the same USB interface as my wife's and son's phones I first ordered a different ruggedized VZW phone, because it was advertised with more features and was well reviewed. The problem was, the other brand of phone did not come with a USB cable, nor was one available. While I was searching around for the cable online, I tried out the extra features, such as the thermometer- it was off by 4 to 6 degrees Farenheit, making it pretty useless. The LED flashlight was nice, but not nicer than being able to surf the WEB surfside. So, I exchanged it for this much less glitzy Motorola Barrage. I have already used it to get my email and upload documents far from any available Wi-Fi hot spots (cool!) and it has come in handy when I am in the shower and I get an important phone call (like from my wife). It also uses the same cord as the other cell phones in the family, which is great on trips. It has some other surprisingly useful features. For example, I can make a call without looking at the phone because it pronounces the names of my contacts as I scroll through the list. Also, it is actually very useful to know who is calling without having to put down whatever I am carrying to look at the cell phone display. The voice recognition, e.g., ""Call... John... Mobile,"" actually work on this phone for me and that is a first. I already have several great digital cameras, so I always thought having a camera phone was sort of stupid. But the other day I bought something at the lumber store that didn't have a sticker. No problem, I just snapped a picture of the display tag, and the cashier keyed the SKU right in. I put one of those 4 GB micro SD cards into the phone for $11 so I can transfer files back and forth from the phone to my laptop, or to other computers. That's when one gewfy 'feature' of the phone showed up. When you first plug it in to the USB cable, you get to choose between ""Media Sync Mode"" and ""Modem Mode."" Choosing ""Media Sync"" gives you the option to either download music, or NOT. ""Not"" mode does nothing... nada... Zippo... except to charge the battery. If you want to transfer files or photos, you have to go into ""Tools"" and select ""USB Mass Storage."" But even *that* is gewfy, because there are two menu items that have the phrase 'USB'. To transfer files, you want the one that results from, ""MENU, Settings & Tools, 2. Tools, 8. USB Mass Storage,"" and *not* ""MENU, Settings & Tools, 9. USB Mode."" Pretty stinkin' ridiculous, eh? The bluetooth pairing thingie works, but I can't get used to making or answering calls on a headset. Plus, people who walk around in public talking to themselves seem icky to me. I might get a car adapter someday, and I am confident this phone will work with it. Other than that one weird menu glitch, I really, really like this phone.",0.113702603543029
B002WTC1NG,Motorola Barrage V860 Phone (Verizon Wireless)	,Motorola,TinkerMan,Hit or (mostly) Miss Phone....,"My wife and I finally decided to upgrade our VZW phones but really didn't want or need ""smart"" phones. Unfortunately, most carriers have drastically reduced the number and quality of basic ""feature"" phones they carry - I suspect it's an underhanded effort to ""encourage"" customers to buy the more expensive phones and data plans. At the kiosk where we shopped - there were only 3 feature phones available and the Motorola Barrage seemed to be the pick of the litter. My Barrage has worked well since the purchase - however - I make very few calls during the day and the ones I do make are brief. On the other hand, my wife's Barrage was a disaster... she uses hers just a little more than I use mine - but is not, by any means, a cell phone junkie. Her initial charge lasted 5 days - GREAT! The next full charge lasted about 3 days - HUH? The next full charge lasted less than a day - CRAP!!! Verizon gladly offered to exchange the phone - but they were 'out of stock'. We waited several days for a replacement - only to learn that the phone was being discontinued and there would be NO new ones. A couple of these phones were finally located at a WalMart about 20 mile away - so, I made the trip and exchanged the phones. HOWEVER, her new phone was worse than the first.... the initial full charge lasted just a little over a day. I did an internet search and found this to be quite a common problem for this phone. I tried every posted ""fix"" to no avail. My wife grew tired of dealing with it and finally exchanged her Barrage for an LG Clout... which has performed flawlessly and gives her 5 days to a full charge. I'm just praying MY Barrage doesn't peter out now. Maybe I'm lucky and got a ""good"" one. Other minor complaints.... the battery cover is hard to install properly - even the Verizon agent didn't know how. If the cover is not FULLY seated, the phone WILL NOT be water resistant..... you can find this discussed on several different websites as well. Once you learn a few tricks, it becomes easier to do. The MP3 player interface is the quite dated and clunky old Verizon ""V Cast"".... it's high time Verizon reworked this dinosaur into something a little more flexible. There is no graphic equalizer - heck, there's not even a basic tone adjustment - so you'll have to live with the fairly flat audio the player has. The headphone jack is 2.5mm - unfortunately, common headphones have a 3.5mm plug and won't work without an adapter (I finally bought a pair of BlackBerry earbuds with a 2.5mm plug on Amazon for $4 and they work GREAT!!!). The Barrage is a bit thick compared to other flip phones and may be uncomfortable to hold in smaller hands. The thickness also makes finding a suitable case difficult. So - only 1 (out of 3) of these phones worked for us.... those are not great odds. I like mine so far - but I'm nervous that it won't last and I can not recommend this phone without some serious reservations. If you're seriously considering this phone (as Dirty Harry would say) you've got to ask yourself one question: ""Do I feel lucky?"" Well do ya, punk?",0.0367777477152477
B002WTC1NG,Motorola Barrage V860 Phone (Verizon Wireless)	,Motorola,D. T. Kleven,This phone did not hold up for me.,"I admit, I'm a contractor and I'm very tough on phones. That's why I try to buy the ""ruggedized"" phones, the heavy duty ones that are supposed to be able to handle some abuse. This phone did not live up to it's billing. I even bought two separate protective cases, a leather one, and then a hard rubber one. Even with the cases on, the phone was useless after only a month and a half. First the front screen cracked. No big deal, it happens on pretty much every phone I've had. But then, the main screen went blank, and I was left with trying to dial or pull up numbers blindly from memory. After a month and a half? very disappointed. My first phone was a motorola, and I loved it, this one did not hold up. I went with a Casio GzOne Ravine 2 Verizon, instead and have been extremely happy with it. The front screen hasn't even cracked yet, and it's been over 6 months. I'd skip the Barrage and to with a Ravine 2.",-0.0122414622414622

Reception seems to be good to excellent everywhere. Easy to use-I'm old, and not adept at gadget laden phone. 5 months out it's been reliable so far. (1) No opinion on the camera. Phone camera are crap compared to real cameras as far as I'm concerned, so I keep a real camera on me or near. (2) Not much account for texting. I hate texting, but my friends send them to me anyway, and in abundance. It works, but is slow and inefficient. (3) Things like input and deletion of contacts has been very simple for me, and understand I am a technophobe. (4) Could hardly be easier to carry. (5) I am beginning to maybe trust Verizon, so I could see being on a plan, but the month-to-month no contract aspect of this thing is very appealing. In general I trust phone companies less than I trust MDs or Cygna insurance, which is to say not at all. (6) Charges pretty quickly on even a vehicle charger. And chargers for this odd obscure little piglet have not been hard to find even around here.",0.0338541666666666
B003FCO9XE,Samsung Smooth Verizon Wireless Prepaid Mobile Cell Camera Phone CDMA	,Samsung,Desert Dasey,Purchased as spare / emergency phones,"I purchased these 2 additional phones as replacements for the current ones my sweetheart keeps destroying....over & over & over. I purchased the originals in 2009. He destroyed his 1st one (temper..temper..) in 2010. So I traided and gave him mine so he could go on a trip and be in touch if needed. On returning, that phone was run over...bummer! Replaced 2 more, Yup, his was accidentally dumped into a glass of fortified grapefruit juice.(that doesn't work well) I bought another one for him which he still has (so far). So, I decided to buy 2 more and keep them in stock for insurance. One thing I am disappointed with is they come with a $10.00 (30 Day) initial allotment but that is not added to your balance when you have to replace the phone. Oh well! I like these phones because I can get the service for $100.00 a year for now. We only use them for emergency so I re-fill both of them once a year. I just don't think anyone can get better service for that amount. I gave it 3 stars because I / we don't use all the bells and wistles it is capable of and it doesn't come close to being in competition with many other phones but I can take pictures, not the greatest quality but still OK. and e-mail. It's capable of internet connection if needed but that eats up minutes instantly. It has more capabilities also but being financially restricted I just keep expenses as minimal as possible. (K.I.S.S.) These are OK phones and for emergencies it takes care of that requirement. The cell service itself is normal & adequate. Yes I would recommend it to anyone as an emergency phone.",0.2049242424242424

B003FCO9XE,Samsung Smooth Verizon Wireless Prepaid Mobile Cell Camera Phone CDMA	,Samsung,A techno geek,"Avoid like the plague - bad hardware, Keystone Cops service","Thank you Samsung for guaranteeing I never buy another cell phone made by you. After 8 months of use, this phone started making beeps when I plugged in the charger and gave spurious warning messages that it had the ""wrong battery"", ""unsupported battery"", even though it would eventually usually recharge. I called Samsung warrantee service, and they made a ticket and UPS label to send in the battery. Within two weeks after I sent it in, they finished the service and sent me an email they had shipped out a replacement. After 3 weeks it hadn't arrived, and when I checked the tracking number, I discovered they'd mailed it to some guy in Florida, not Hawaii. It took me a month of multiple phone calls and submissions on the web to get Samsung Service in Plano, Texas, to send me another battery. When it arrived and I put it in the handset, it displayed the same malfunction. So the problem was in the handset, not the battery. I called Samsung and they told me to send in the handset without the battery or the door, which I did. Three weeks later, I get an email from Samsung that they have received the shipment and ""*** PLEASE DO NOT REPLY TO THIS EMAIL*** We regret to inform you that your Samsung ticket [#####] was rejected due to the following reason. REJECTED - INCOMPLETE KIT The original item will be shipped back to you unrepaired."" and in a separate email, ""Your product was shipped on 20101122 at 102557 EST."" That message, though, was completely erroneous. Nothing was shipped back to me. It was followed by ""We received your Samsung SCH-U350MBPVZW on 11/23/2010 at 12:41 EST"". A week later, I got another message, ""Problem found: LOCK UP DURING OPERATION (SW) SOFTWARE EMERGENCY RECOVERY Solution: S/W Updated Passed All Functional Testing"", and a week after that, the handset arrived back, and now appears to be working. Would I sign up again for such an experience with a cell phone malfunction? No. There were just too many mistakes made here for this to be a fluke. Something is systematically wrong with Samsung USA.

I can also access GPS, the internet, my emails, look up restraunts in surrounding areas and it has many more features that I did not even know was on the phone when I purchased it.

I sometimes place calls which are short and to the point, less than 5 minutes, I hardly notice my balance dropping at all. The best part is my bill is around $20.00 a month compared to all of the other phones that I've owned which ended up being over $100.00 or closer to $200.00 and they always added in the fees for God only knows what.

Anyway what I wanted was a tough phone with 3G. (At&T doesn't have 2G in some parts of the country which I found out on our last motorcycle trip with my old RAZZ). My wants are simply, good phone service, big screen, one button speed dial, answer by opening lid and again, TOUGH ! Have had the phone two months and with an easy modification am very pleased with the phone. Read a lot of reviews and the most common complaint was the PTT feature being turned on often. Yes I found this to be a real pain, often having to press buttons to tell the phone I didn't want to enable the service. After waiting the 30 day return period I fixed that issue. Took a razor blade and carefully scrapped the case around the PTT button, then around the button. This was done to get good adhesion for step two, superglue. I carefully put a heavy bead of superglue around the PTT button. PTT hasn't activated in over a month, now I'm happy with the phone.",0.1397023809523809
B003P2VNAQ,"Samsung Rugby II, Black (AT&T)	",Samsung,Chuck,step down from Motorola Tundra,"I got this phone a week ago because ATT didn't stock the Motorola Tundra. Tundra had been through 4 years of rough use including purposly throwing it on the floor when someone was bragging about their new smart phone. I wasn't impressed with the construction when I purchased it but had to have a replacement. The Rugby II was the toughest phone stocked at the store. The included software to sync to my PC does not work, nor do any newer versions downloaded from Samsung. There is no support through Samsung for their software that I can find. The soft keys are programmable and I have made them match my old tundra. That is a real plus. I have read a lot of complaints about inability to disable PTT but I don't think it can be disabled on the tundra either. There is no option to disable the data keys. The Tundra allowed locking the browser and other data usage so there were no inadvertent connections. IM is the only lockable internet ap in the Rugby II Tundra was able to usb connect to PC for data transfer. Rugby II has to have a mini sim card installed before it will even try.

It consistently performs very poorly as far as reception goes. I've had to terminate calls because I couldn't hear the ther party well enough to continue. I never had this problem with my old Motorola EM330. Texting is a chore with the poorly laid out format requiring you to change screens for simple punctuation or numeric functions. AT&T keeps trying to blame the reception issues on a local network problem. A coworker has an identical phone with the identical problem.

B003P2VNAQ,"Samsung Rugby II, Black (AT&T)	",Samsung,Journey B,Much better than the original!,"I had an absolutely terrible experience with the original Rugby.. I had 3 of them that broke inside of a year (from the *original* date of purchase, mind you). B/c of the false information AT&T gave me on multiple calls (5 calls!), I could not get a new, alternative brand phone. So, I was forced into The Rugby II. Well, I'm happy to say it is much more reliable than the original! I haven't had any dropped calls. I haven't had any spontaneous connecting to the internet, either. The PTT button is still in the same spot as the original, but I don't seem to hit it as often. *shrug* I have a data plan, but this is not user friendly for that purpose. It will take pretty decent pictures when it's folded. The texting bit is still a hassle, though. Predictive texting is easier, but a bit sketchy, and I haven't found a way to get rid of words from its vocabulary once they've been added. It's bulky and heavy, too, but it helps me keep up with it. If I'm suddenly feeling lighter, I know I've left my phone somewhere. LOL If you want a feather-light phone or one with all the bells and whistles, this isn't the phone you want. You'll need a heavy duty case, too. I use a magnetic one made by body glove. I haven't had any difficulty pairing the Rugby II to my mac or my phone, or my PDA for that matter (BUT it won't SYNC with the Mac or PDA b/c they're not Windows machines). I can send pics, videos, etc. with no difficulty. Also, on the previous phones, I don't know if there was a voice dial option, but it's on the II. It's just a big P.I.T.A. to use, and it takes too long to respond. Don't try to voice dial 911. You'll die before the call's been made (maybe I'm exaggerating a little bit! lol). The memory's decent, but that was never a complaint of mine with the original, either. From a non-smartphone point of view, this phone may intimidate those who are not very tech-savvy. It took awhile for me to get used to the Rugbys after having a more ""consumer-ized"" phone. Initially I felt like Jethro Gibbs (NCIS fans).. ""how does this damn thing work?"" ""Can't you reboot it?"" LOL The front display powers off too quickly, but that is also true of the original Rugby. Now that my faith in Samsung has turned slightly for the better again, I'm getting a Samsung WEP570 bluetooth earpiece. I'll review that soon, too. Potential Rugby II users: It's not as super cool as other phones out there, but it'll 'git 'er done.' Just be prepared to be patient. It's NOT lightning fast.. Oh, and you still can't read or reply to texts when you're on a call, but you can send them. And that kind of defeats the purpose of texting.",0.1843728477961432
B003P2VNAQ,"Samsung Rugby II, Black (AT&T)	",Samsung,scoutmom,Defective Product with invalid waranty,"My son is hard on his phones, so we purchased a Samsung Ruby I for him, which lasted over two years. When that phone broke, we decided to try the newer Rugby II. After only two months, the phone would not charge. We bought a new battery and an external charger; still would not turn on. I called Samsung, but because he had a small crack in the outerscreen, the waranty was void. I was told that even though the cracked screen had nothing to do with the charging problem, the charging problem would not be covered under waranty and I would be responsilbe for all repairs, including the screen, and I wouldn't know the cost until I sent the phone to them. Instead I took the phone to a phone repair shop. They checked the phone and said the power supply was defective and it would cost more to fix than the phone is worth. It is extreemly annoying that a ""Rugged"" phone would quit after only two months and that the waranty is void because of a basically cosmetic issue with the outer screen. This phone was definatley a waste of time, energy and money for us and an example of poor customer service on the part of Samsung.

Samsung tech support first told me I had a bad data cable, then that I needed to re-load the software, then finally admitted it wasn't going to work. No more Samsungs for me.

The ever-reliable Nokia had served me faithfully for 7 full years when ATT determined that it couldn't tolerate such superb service in its network. The planet's largest telecommunications company sent a note advising their non-support for excellence but offering a ""free"" upgrade at an ATT store. I went in. Now the story gets ugly. 1. The store employees urged against the several ""free"" phones, pointing out that they were unpopular models for which ATT was discontinuing sale. They were simply offloading what should have been landfill. 2. I asked, then, what would be a no-frills model that was as rugged as Old Nokia. They replied, ""None,"" but did recommend the misnamed Rugby as the next best thing. The catch: since I was declining a ""free"" phone, I'd need to buy the ""reliable"" model. 3. In ""upgrading"" to a worse phone, ATT charged an additional upgrade fee, cut my minutes in half, and locked in a new 2 year contract. Because I was leaving on a business trip for the Middle East the next day, I sucked it up and bought the Rugby. The story gets uglier. 1. The phone seriously overheats after about 15 minutes of use. 2. The buttons and menu are aggressively counter-intuitive. 3. The voice quality is the the worst I have ever encountered. 4. The PTT feature has been located such that it cannot be avoided--and which brings additional charges when used. (But this can be disabled. Pry out the button, then clip the stem from its back. Replace. You'll be happy to have a less functional phone) If the young revolutionaries in Cairo had all had Rugbys last year, Mubarak could never have been toppled",0.0721320346320346

Thus, there is a PTT key on the left-hand side of the phone that is extremely sensitive and almost unavoidable when you open or otherwise handle the phone. As a result, I've received the PTT initialization prompt about three dozen times during my first two days of ownership. If you WANT PTT, that might not be so bad; but I want neither to use nor to pay for the feature, so this is a problem I encounter virtually every time I use the phone. I used the Samsung web site to ask how I might go about disabling the feature and received a response revealing that Samsung doesn't know how to do it. They suggested that I get in touch with my service provider, which I will do eventually, but I am stunned that Samsung doesn't have a fix for this. I would not have purchased the phone if I had known about this problem. This is my first -- and likely my last -- product from Samsung, and I don't much like their web site either.

The button will no longer depress and activate the annoying PTT message, and if need be, I can simply reverse it by peeling the silicone out of the button recess.

My father who is quite inept with technology and notoriously hard on his phones chose the Rugby as it seemed to offer simplicity and durability. It seems like it is so until you start endlessly having to decline adding services. He doesn't necessarily want Push To Talk but EVERY TIME he answers the Rugby his finger rests on the PTT button and he first has to decline adding that feature before he can answer. The only way to disable it is to physically damage the button so it will not activate. The large center button is of course a browser launch shortcut which he hit's all the time. Was there not a class action about data use entrapment? There should be another. There is a GPS button which is easy for a senior to hit that also launches a service he does not want and cannot be disabled. The menu is a further fleece attempt festooned with AT&T services he doesn't want or need. Were we not stuck with AT&T due to location this would certainly have been the final straw. I'm looking forward to Apple finally getting the iPhone somewhere else so AT&T's subscriber pen get's busted open and they finally have to stop shaking down customers for accidental service in order to retain them. It's gotten unacceptable. + Two stars for what I feel is good Samsung quality (should have been 4). - Eleventy stars for AT&T customer disdain.,0.0517085137085137

B003P2VNAQ,"Samsung Rugby II, Black (AT&T)	",Samsung,Pepe Guitar,Samsung Rugby II will not connect to any PC,"Somebody has to tell the Samsung people that this phone has serious problem connecting to PC's. I have spent more than 20 hours on the phone talking with several different Samsung technical people and they couldn't help me find any way to connect the Samsung SGH-A847 Rugby II to any type of PC. I have three computers, one an HP desktop with Windows 7 64 bit, the other an HP desktop with Windows Vista 32 bit, the third one a laptop with Windows Vista 32 bit. For hours on end I followed the detailed instructions of Samsung Support technicians and to no avail. The phone is detected by the computer (the computer makes a sound and there is for a moment a bar in the Samsung New PC Studio software), but that's it. I purchased and added a memory card to use the 'mass storage' function, hoping this will give me some kind of connectivity, but it didn't work either. Furthermore, and this is very unfortunate to the users, the Samsung ""New PC Studio"" software has not been licensed and approved by Microsoft and the software is labeled by all Windows computers as a dangerous program that will harm your computer when you are in the process of installing it. Of course this is not true, (Norton Antivirus says the program is safe) but right now the problem is that Windows computers are labeling the Samsung software as dangerous and harmful when it is not and probably affecting its functionality. The Samsung ""New PC Studio"" is the software that is supposed to let you communicate your phone with your computer. The program loads and works but will not 'sync' with the Samsung SGH-A847 phone or connect to it, no matter how hard you try or how many tricks you pursue. Every time you get the message that there are no devices connected. In today's world, an 'advanced' cellular phone that is not recognized by any computer and will not 'sync' or connect with the computer no matter what you try or do, is simply not acceptable. There are also no updates or upgrades to the phone software available yet. I have also called AT&T and they don't know anything at all about this problem or care at all about it. They believe is a Samsung problem and not their problem to resolve.

I became obsessed with checking the phone to ensure it was still on since I used the phone for my job, and like most working folks, my phone calls are super important. Honestly, this obsession started to ruin my life and I'm not even exagerating. I removed the memory card because I thought that might have something to do with it...nope. I cleaned the terminals making contact with the battery...nope. I reset the phone, thereby erasing all of my data and contact information...nope. I didn't swap out the battery because the phone wasn't that old. Eventually, one day, whilst hanging a ceiling fan in my house, the phone rang, which was remarkable given the aforementioned. This was a particularly tense moment of the installation - the moment when you've just finished mating the wires and are holding the motor in place while you screw it in to the ceiling-mounted anchor.

B003P2VNAQ,"Samsung Rugby II, Black (AT&T)	",Samsung,J. Nicholas,This is a great phone for those not interested in smartphones,"I've had this phone for over a year now and have to say, it's done quite well for me. It's not too technical with the features and has a front screen on the outside. Why I picked this out was because it's a flip phone. . . those who have had open faced phones know how they tend to dial unexpectedly! The phone's camera does quite well (standard quality though), although most do nowadays. One of my favorite features about this phone is the customization with the menu. It allows you to customize the shortcuts and also you get to pick out your four top menu options (ex. text, pics, video etc. . . you choose) My last camera was a motorolla razr and found that this is a much tougher phone with the look and feel. It's not the fanciest but it will do all you need for your phone needs (and you're not required to sign up on a service contract for internet etc.) The only features I would say this phone lags in is the speaker. It's not too bad but it can be somewhat blurry on phone conversations, almost like you are hearing someone talk through a pillow (but does not occur too frequently, not really an issue). The other is that there are some buttons somewhere that get pushed while the phone is in my pocket, the camera takes pictures and when you go through your picture folder you see a whole load of black pictures (from being in your pocket). But it is a great phone overall, it is solid enough for me, has a decent features and does very well for a phone that isn't a 'smart phone'.",0.1006211180124223
B003P2VNAQ,"Samsung Rugby II, Black (AT&T)	",Samsung,loce_the_wizard,28 days later and . . .,". . . my second Samsung Rugby II phone has been returned to the point of purchase. I had the first one for two days before the battery quit holding a charge for longer than a few hours. I would charge it all night, but by the next afternoon, the battery was running out of power. Now, this problem occurred even if I did not actually use the phone, and no applications were left running either. So I swapped that phone for a second one, and it lasted about 8 days before the same battery problem recurred. I phoned ATT customer service each time to document the problem and asked if there were any issues being tracked for these phones. The polite staff there told me that there were no issues, so I asked that my report be logged, and I asked for a replacement battery. ATT shipped the new replacement battery, and this one worked great. . . for about 8 days before the same battery problem recurred. So the phone ended up being plugged into its charger for many hours each day and night, but, when this phone is charging, you cannot receive incoming calls. Why Samsung did not consider that drawback a huge problem is puzzling, confounding, and unforgivable. Combine that issue with the irritating ""push to talk"" button which is nearly impossible to avoid, and the net result is a high frustration factor. I can understand now why these phone are supposedly rugged and shockproof. The urge to hurl the Rugby II against the closest hard surface can be hard to check. I managed to ditch this clunker just before my 30-day trial period ended. Let me say, it has been a trial, too. I guess many of you love your Rugby phones, and I am glad you had better experiences with yours than I did with either of the two I tried.",0.1041897233201581
B003P2VNAQ,"Samsung Rugby II, Black (AT&T)	",Samsung,EGC10,All Physical,"After using the new Samsung Rugby II cell phone from AT&T for almost a year now, I am still struggling and still just as frustrated with it as I was when I first starting to use it. Although the physical features of the phone are very nice, there are too many technical inconveniences about the phone from the text messaging to the general usage of the phone that have caused me to literally hate it. When Alltel made the switch to AT&T after being bought out, I was forced to choose a new phone from a list of phones comparable to the current phone I had at the time. I really liked the current phone I had because it was simple and easy to use so I knew what to look for in a new phone, provided it had a rugged body, and a few new perks. After reviewing each of the phones and their features, there was only one phone that filled that description. I chose the Samsung Rugby II after reviewing all of its features and descriptions displayed on the AT&T website. I was not familiar with AT&T phones or the particular type of phone at the time, so I had to go out on a whim to assume it was as good as it sounded. The website explained all of the physical features that made the phone unique as well as a few technological features. The physical features the website displayed were the ruggedized body which could withstand shock, humidity, high temperatures, resist dirt, and repel rain. Some of the technological features displayed were Push-to-Talk (PTT) capability, which is like a walkie-talkie in your phone, and built in GPS. The physical features of the phone are true to what the website states. The body of the phone is heavy and thick; a rugged body that has stood up to a few crashes to the ground without problems. The battery cover has a twist lock on it that seals it tight to the phone to prevent water or humidity from seeping in, and good seals along the outside to resist dirt and rain. The physical features are all a plus, especially to someone who works construction or such job that a phone would benefit from those features. My problems came with the technology of the phone. My first problem was more with the company in the fact that the built in GPS and PTT capabilities were not included with the plan and would cost an extra $9.99/ month for each, putting almost twenty extra dollars on my bill each month. The website did not state that those features were add-ons or that they would cost extra. Not to mention, there are two buttons on the phone specifically for GPS and PTT features and if I hit one of them on accident, I could get charged. There are very little customizing features that allow me to change what buttons do what which makes it difficult to avoid pushing buttons that will take me to the internet and charge me. My second problem(s) were with calls and call waiting, receiving text and voicemails, and the phone turning off at random times. If the phone goes out of the service area, I have to turn the phone off and back on to make a phone call once back in the service area. If I receive a call waiting, the phone will not automatically switch back to original call once the call waiting has hung up; I have to manually do it, which has caused me to hang up on people by pushing the button too much. If receive a text message or voicemail while out of service, I will sometimes not receive them for as many as three days later for some unknown reason. At times, when I am on the phone connected to my Bluetooth, my phone will re-start itself while I am on the phone with someone, causing the call to be disconnected. One minor issue that caused a big problem was with the alarm. If the phone is on vibrate or silent, the alarm is too, so if I didn't want to be disturbed in the middle of the night by drunk-dialers or prank calls, I'd better had a back-up plan. I found that out when I received a phone call from work wondering if I was coming in or not as I was already an hour late. Most phones will turn themselves on if an alarm is set to go off and the phone is off. But my most hated part of this phone has to be the text messaging. With a new phone I expected the text messaging to be even better then it was when the T9 option came out. T9 is suppose to be faster because it is suppose to predict the text you are going to write. That is not the case; in fact, on this phone it is even worse than ever. This phone has to have more steps then the world trade center to write and send a text. It does not recognize frequently used words or phrases so I am constantly pushing more buttons to switch to the word I want then if I was just to do it manually. It does not show predictions for the word I am going to type and I have to delete an entire word just to change one letter. I also have to go through about six steps just to send the message. Basically, texting for me is slower then to just call the person I want to talk to. There is no reason for me to keep this phone and the physical features are not worth the frustration this phone has caused me. I consider myself to be pretty good at figuring new technologies out once I have had enough time to play around with them but, in this case I have had this phone for almost a year do not feel as though I should still be confused by it. In this day of technology, I would think we would be past this point. This phone seems to have been a step down from that and I hope AT&T will recognize that.",0.0551488934192422

The reception was extremely good, especially considering that she lives in rural West Virginia. The phone has a very user friendly menu system with readable fonts on a color display. Unfortunately, so far I have only been able to test the phone while talking with Verizon ""marketeers"". After opening the Gusto I was greeted by a very convenient message to activate the phone. I clicked the activate option and was put on hold for a very reasonable period of time while being entertained by Spanish guitar music. The marketing rep answered. To my amazement the rep informed me that I had won a $500 gift and that all I needed to do was pay $14.95 to have it shipped to my door. I reported that I was not interested in the gift but the marketer was persistent. I finally hung up without activation. The next day I tried again and dialed *611. The support person gave me a toll free number where I could pursue activation. I dialed the number and once again was greeted by a marketer who explained that I had won $500. After asking how his company could survive by giving away so many $500 gifts for $20 phone purchases the marketer told me I could bypass his office and attain activation by dialing the number again an pressing ""option 3"". After I hung up I was unable to locate ""option 3"", so here I sit with a phone hosted by a company that obviously makes it immmensely difficult to activate without accepting a $500 gift.

The reason for only a three star rating? I feel that Samsung comes way too close to false advertising stating that this phone is ""blue tooth capable"". Sure you can use a blue tooth with it, they just don't mention anywhere (phone info. at store or owner's manual) that only two brands on the planet will work with it (Jawbone and Bose) and these start at $130! That's more then I paid for the phone! So I bought a basic (and cheap) Samsung phone and if I want a blue tooth I will need to fork over $130-$200? Um, no!

Oh, it still functioned as a phone just fine, but I had to keep a standby battery charged up to swap out, the radio feature never seemed to work well with their idiotic connection system, and most importantly my friends were posting photos on Facebook that they took with their cel telephones, without having to lug around a camera, and I wanted to get in on that. So, after looking at several phones at the Verizon store, I decided on the Samsung Gusto. What a mistake. For one, the tech at the store was unable to simply copy my old phone book from the old phone to the new one. I had to manually enter every single name and number from my list. Hundreds of contacts. For another, the camera ""feature"" in this phone is useless. Oh, it snaps the pictures just fine, and there are even a reasonable number of creative options available for the adequate 640x480 images. The problem is they are impossible to download off of the camera to view, edit or post. You can supposedly send them from the phone to a website to view them. But after spending over an hour setting up the account and website, I found that it just doesn't work. The obvious method, which would be to connect the phone to the USB port on your computer-won't work either. Evidently this is because this goofy knick-knack has some sort of cheesy proprietary software that is INCOMPATIBLE WITH EVERYTHING ELSE, which also explains why the phone book was untransferable. The salesman at the Verizon store didn't even know this, and Samsung doesn't point this out, either. You can look at the pictures on the phone's screen. That's it.

B0046REOWS,Samsung T201G Prepaid Phone (Net10)	,Samsung,J.L. Populist,A Surprise for a Freebie,I bought this refurbished cell phone directly from Net10 online as part of a package deal. It was basically free with the purchase of a 30 day/750 minute phone card. I also got the universal accessories kit free. I have used this phone for a month. Last week I dropped it on a hard floor. After putting the battery and cover back on it the phone has shown no damage or problems. It appears to be durable and still works very well. Three things make an impression on me. 1) This phone is small. Not clunky. 2) Signal reception is great. No dropped calls yet! 3) The quality. I expected that a free phone in this price range would be loose or cheaply built. This phone is much better than that. The other surprise was the universal accessory kit which usually goes for around $15. It came free with a promotion code that I used during the purchase. The phone pouch is durable and the attachments are quality items. Everything works including the car charger. If you read the fine print on the Net10 website they normally send the phones with a battery and a home/wall charger. Net10 service is dependable and the phone cards can cost as little as 3 cents/minute up to the 10 cents/minute standard cards available in stores. I did call Net10 customer support to verify my order and out of curiosity about their service. What I found was that the initial response wasn't very good but I was passed off to another service tech who answered my questions quickly. This may be an instance where it depends on the particular tech that answers your call. But I did get an efficient human response to my call. Reloading minutes is easy and hassle-free also.

With tax, about $16.70 per month for the 200 minutes and service. Any leftover minutes roll over each month and are never lost as long as you keep the service. This phone and the Net10 service have been excellent in my opinion. Talk time is around 4 hours and standby time is almost 2 weeks before charging is needed. I even purchased a spare battery for when we travel and alternate batteries every couple months. I love it when my wife goes shopping in town and can keep in touch for such a low monthly cost.

Yes, you've read it right, 6 years! I came from AT&T. I got tired of being on a plan, so I went from a package with AT&T to a pay-as-you-go with AT&T. When rates started inching up and my bill cost more, it was time for me to switch. I stumbled upon Net10. They had flip phones, carry over minutes and cost effective pay-as-you-go. I ordered the phone plus accessories. It arrived quickly! Set-up was prompt when I called in and I have that phone, Motorola V171, to this day.

Now to inform you why I scored them a 4 instead of a 5. - The customer service is not what is was when I first signed up with them. When I do call in for a question it takes FOREVER to get someone and then once I do, we have a language barrier, so BE PATIENT. - I hate that they got rid of their 1 year pre-paid card 1500 minutes for $150 or $100 (I can't remember which one Now there is a $100 card for 1000 minutes lasting 9 months, I believe. Other than that, if you are in to fancy phones and you're a HEAVY phone user, Net10 may not be for you. They have 2 pay plans $15(150 minutes) and $25 per month(250 minutes)none are roll over. Then there is the pay-as-you-go (with roll over minutes). They don't carry iphones and their phones are approx. 2 years behind the lastest and greatest.

B004C7NVD0,Samsung Convoy SCH-U640 Cell Phone Ruggedized PTT 2+ megapixel Camera for Verizon	,Samsung,JR,Samsung U640 Great Flip Phone !!,"Purchased used from NuTwo on Amazon. It was rated as in ""very good"" condition. I would rate it as in excellent condition. The packaging was professional / good quality. The phone arrived ahead of schedule. Highly recommend seller. Now to the phone itself: *Speech / Sound: Very clear sound quality, even the speakerphone mode is very clear with minimum distortion when volume @ max Contacts on other end of phone conversation have indicated they can hear me very clearly w/ good tone & no distortion. Has option to answer call & talk w/ flip closed. (I really like this option) *Screens / Keypad Inside and outside screens are large enough to read (I'm over 50 and have slightly degraded vision). Font adjustment is adequate. Screens are clear and bright. The phone feels and appears sturdy (not water proof / resistant). The flip screen is easy to open / close. The inside keys are large enough so someone with larger hands won't push extra keys by mistake and someone with less than perfect vision can see them clear enough. The keys have a very good / responsive feel. The software menus are adequately easy to navigate and customize. Camera / MicroSD / USB / Bluetooth: The 2.0Mp camera is good. The camcorder function works well. The only drawback is no flash or light assist. The U660 model has the flash / flashlight. The good news is it's Micro SD slot. I inserted a 16GB Sandisk MicroSD and it worked flawlessly for both pics and camcorder. You are given option to save photos / video to limited internal memory then xfer to SD, or you can set option in phone to automatically save to SD. I have a USB data cable on order and have not tried moving data to PC via USB. I'm hoping xferring contacts will be as easy as the SD setup. There are external keys for taking pics / video without opening phone. This phone is also capable of voice command. I played with it briefly and seems to work o.k. but haven't really been into it yet. The phone has Blue Tooth capability and I do plan on ordering a wireless / hands free headset, I just haven't landed on one yet. **Speakerphone is good for voice, but if you're going to play tunes you might want to consider decent headphones or play on other audio device. I plugged in mid-grade headphones and tunes sounded good. Internet: This phone is 3G. Aside from that I can't say much other than it appears to work well. I really don't browse the net on phone, I use PC for that. Carrier compatibility: The phone I purchased is a Verizon / contract (not pre-paid) / CDMA / no simm card / clear ESN. **This phone IS compatible with Calif. Lifeline through ReachOut (Nexus owns ReachOut / Verizon owns Nexus) Cons: *No Cam light (U660 has light) *Vibrate mode a little wimpy, could be slightly stronger Conclusions: Great phone for us ""throw back"" flip phone users who aren't ready for a smart phone yet. This phone has more capability than I will ever use. I have only scratched the surface of the software options.",0.2570145089285713

Scott,"Still the best--Original Samsung Convoy Cell Phone from TargetWireless, refurbished","This purchase has been an outstanding experience. This is the same model phone that Consumer Reports rated a best buy at the time I bought it the first time 10 years ago or more. Customer reviews of subsequent models have said that this one is the best. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a rugged phone with great voice quality and a lit keypad with keys big enough for my big hands. By rugged I mean that I dropped my first one on the floor a number of times over the years without breaking it. I got Verizon on the phone and made sure my contacts were backed up and then activated the phone. Easy! As for TargetWireless, I started by asking them a question. I had an answer back within two hours. I ordered the phone. They shipped it the same day. It arrived earlier than promised, looking new in a small white box with places for the phone and charger, both in little plastic bags. It even has clear thin protective covers on the displays!

Because my assumption was that it came with a charger. It did not. After paying for this and getting nothing to charge it with, I am now with a completely useless phone. For the amount paid to get the phone AND get a charger, I could have went with someone else OR purchased another phone. So, if you're looking to get a phone here, I'm sure they are great but don't assume it has everything you need. It didn't. Here's what I've got- it looks good but is completely useless. This, by the way, is more on me for not looking at the right details or asking the right questions. Just the same, it's useless at the moment and I'm rather irritated at having paid as much when I could have gotten something better and more to the point, one that came with everything I needed to be able to use it.

B004GLQTG8,Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited	,Samsung,Anna Browning,Great phone for the $$,"After looking at smart phones, and noting that the user manuals were typically 500 pp. (not, alas, an exaggeration), I realized that a phone of middling intelligence would suit me just fine. The price here was 50% - 60% less than on other sites. It arrived promptly, and does all that I ask it to do: call, text, and function as my alarm clock. It does have Internet connectivity, but it's so slow, it's like time-travel back to the 1990s. I knew that going in, however. If you need to be able to update your twitter and/or Facebook frequently from your phone, keep on looking. If you just want a, you know, a *phone*, this is smart enough.",0.0739087301587301
B004GLQTG8,Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited	,Samsung,Adriano's Mom,"So far, really good! Amazing bargain at $10","This is my third Net10 phone. First two were AT&T phones, lots not to like about AT&T in southwest CT (IMHO), so I made sure this is Verizon, and it is! (G at the end of the name indicates AT&T, C means Verizon.) Most important functionality for me is good coverage (Verizon), good voice commands (reliable Bluetooth) and decent texting ability (not bad on this device). My first phone (Samsung T401G) was a slider, which really does beat the fakeBerry style phone for texting, but the phone had no voice dialing, so Bluetooth was not fully functional. Scratch that. My second phone was a Samsung R455G (AT&T). It looked much like this phone and was actually heftier, nicer casing, a kind of mini-track pad for moving the cursor. It looked more like the $40 I paid rather than this $10 phone. BUT, the Bluetooth was the weirdest I've ever encountered (I wrote a review on Amazon), and any time you hit the space bar when texting, you were equally likely to get a period. So you. Would get. Sentences. Like this. Scratch that. So, with the R355C I get Verizon connectivity, a NORMAL fully-functional Bluetooth, and the ability to text relatively easily. I actually find typing on the fakeBerry much easier than I would have thought. The worst is all the overlays (for punctuation and things like $ / etc.), which, if you have started losing your fine eyesight as I have, is murder, because it's very hard to see what's on each key. I suppose over the life of the phone I will get used to the most common things I use, but while the phone is new it's a bit of a drag. Not the phone's fault. Unlike some phones with exposed buttons (like the R455G), this phone does not lock itself every time it goes dark, which is a feature I actually like. You can easily lock it (hold the space bar) before putting it in your purse, but if it's sitting on your desk, it doesn't lock up every time it goes dormant, which is great if you're in the midst of a somewhat sporadic text exchange. Somewhat unusually, to unlock the phone you press a soft key and the space bar rather than the center or ""ok"" button, which seems the more common configuration. Haven't had it long enough to comment on battery life, but it seems better than the 455, which had terrible battery life.",0.1511363636363636
B004GLQTG8,Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited	,Samsung,SweetOctober,Samsung r355c n10 phone: One of the best $9.99 deals ever.,"I've been using the Samsung r355c n10 phone for a little over 2 weeks and so far so great. Granted, it's not top quality but considering that it only costs $9.99, this phone is certainly worth the purchase, that is if you're looking for basic phone use (i.e. making phone calls, texting, as well as using the calendar, calculator, alarm etc.). However, if you want a phone that includes a fast internet connection, a camera that takes quality pictures, or video recording ability, you should look elsewhere. As for me, I'm happy with this phone so far and I'm also happy with Amazon. As usual Amazon delivered on time and the merchandise was in perfect condition. Thanks, Amazon :-D Here is what I've experienced & observed so far: BATTERY POWER: I tested the phone out a lot during the first few days. In other words, heavy usage. It took a little over 2 days before I had to recharge the battery. Then when I hardly used the phone (just a few short calls and several texting), the battery lasted for 5-6 days before I had to recharge. As of now, I'm happy with the battery. I just hope it'll stay this strong for a while. CALL RECEPTION: Solid reception. I can hear the person on the other end clearly and vice versa. With regard to dropped calls, I have not had one yet. CAMERA: Pictures aren't the best quality but they come out good enough. Unfortunately, there's no zoom which is a huge bummer for me since I'm a frequent user of the zoom feature. However, there are other features which make taking pictures fun, such as the series shot; mosaic shot; and my favorite, fun frames. For me that makes up a little for the quality of the pics. INTERNET ACCESS: This feature is ok for occasional use. However if you're looking for a phone mostly for internet browsing (if you internet daily for hours), you may want to look around and see what other choices are out there. As for this Samsung r355c phone, it's 10 cents a minute to internet; and be aware that the first minute will be deducted as soon as you press the browser key. The downloading of website pages is a bit slow to complete. I could not browse or navigate through any site until the downloading completely finished. I got 2 minutes deducted, once, for just visiting one page w/o hardly reading anything. If you do get this phone, this feature is not too bad if you have the time to wait for pages to download. KEYPAD: 1). The key buttons are really small which worried me a bit because my fingers are medium sized and I keep my nails really short so I thought I'd have problems (i.e. pressing 2 keys at once or pressing the wrong keys). Surprisingly I've had no trouble typing. It's pretty easy. 2). When not using the phone, it's best to lock the keypad down by holding down the space key for a few seconds. When the keypad is unlocked, it's easy to accidentally hit the browser key unknowingly and be charged for every minute the browser is on. 3). Fyi the red ""End pwr"" key is the ""home"" key. I didn't know that until I read the instruction booklet a few days later. I kept pressing the ""back"" key a few times to get out of features like the camera mode, text messages, calendar, etc. just to get back to the home screen. Doh! SPEAKER: The clarity is excellent. MUCH clearer than my 2 laptops' speakers that's for sure. TEXT MSG: It was nice to find out it only costs 2 &1/2 cents (0.25 minutes) per text compared to the 10 cents (1.00 minute) I used to pay prior to switching to this phone. I also like that there's a character count which lets you know when you're about to hit the maximum (160 character per text). The one thing missing is the copy/cut/paste features. But it's a minor issue considering the price of this phone. TEXT PICTURE MSG: It cost 35 cents (3.50 minutes) to send & to receive a picture text message. I was a little bummed about that but oh well, it's still good. VIDEO RECORDER: there is none :-( I know I'm leaving out info about other features this phone offers, but hopefully what I already have written down will help some people decide whether or not this phone will suit their needs.",0.1215425531914893
B004GLQTG8,Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited	,Samsung,Rick Bennette,Good for the Purpose.,"It looks like a Blackberry, but isn't a smart phone. It does not have the ability to use apps except for those limited few that come with it, but at least it looks more modern than other basic phones. The browser is slow, but you can get your email and Facebook in due time, so it's good in a pinch. Call quality is as good as the Verizon system this phone uses, so if Verizon is good in your area, this phone is as good as it gets for call quality. Test messaging is as good as any smart phone. It has an Mp3 player with playlists, and it will connect to any Bluetooth device to play music in your car or through a Bluetooth speaker. There is no Wi-Fi. I like the real keyboard as opposed to the touch keyboards of other phones. I like the real buttons as opposed to the touch screen, so for me, this works well for my needs.

B004GLQTG8,Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited	,Samsung,Shelly,"For the price, the overall quality, and everything else, this was a steal!","Definitely believe I hit the jackpot when I found this phone. Beforehand, I owned the Motorola flip phone, under Net10. Paid $30 for that, it was great as a starter for my first cell phone, paid for by myself. When my mom was paying my bill, I had the LG900G and it was great, loved the feel, the keyboard, all the little gadgets; absolutely awesome. I decided to shop around for an upgrade, something a little more my speed than a flip phone. After seeing this phone, I read all the reviews because I wanted to make sure I was getting the bang for my buck, even if it was only $10 ($16 & change because of shipping) and I decided that between this and the Net10 with the slide up keyboard, that this phone was the better deal. I've had it for two days now, transferring my number took five minutes online and then another 10-15 minutes with the phone physically. Quick, easy, and done in less than a half hour. I love the feel of the keys (I have tiny hands, so it works well with me) and it can do a lot for the price. Bought a case too, which should arrive to my house today, which I also paid $10 ($5 for the case, $4.95 shipping.) In total, I bought a brand new phone and a brand new case for $26.91, under the price I paid for the flip phone without a case ($30) and I'm very satisfied so far.

B004GLQTG8,Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited	,Samsung,Velia Hernandez,Solid feature phone,"I have been with Net10 for 8 months now and I switched from a Bring Your Own Phone SIM card to this Samsung. My unlocked HP Pre 3 messed up and I saw this for only $9.99 FREE PRIME shipping. It was a steal.This phone is exactly what I needed. It has features many basic phones don't have nowadays. Things like a dedicated camera button, a cover for the USB charging port to avoid dust getting in and a standard headset jack. The menu is very basic, nothing out of the ordinary, easy to read. As far as the network goes, I did some research and after activating this phone I am certain the networks got switched from T-Mobile to Verizon Wireless coverage. This phone runs on Verizon's CDMA 1X network. Which is also a big plus for me because I have better signal and I'm saving $5 with Net10 over Verizon's Unlimited for basic phones plan. Very happy with my purchase. The only negative thing I would point out is the keyboard itself feels really cheap. It has good tactile feedback but you can definitely feel the cheapness of it. I don't really mind as long as I can text fast on it. Which I think is achievable once I get used to the keyboard. If this phone messes up I can always get a second one.

B004GLQTG8,Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited	,Samsung,Trixy,"Excellent Bargain, Terrible Service","Rightfully, I should probably give this product one star rather than three, but I’m considering the possibility that I just got a defective cell. I bought this as a cheap efficient way to make and receive important calls. Unfortunately it’s never worked. Out of the box, the phone proved incapable of keeping a charge longer than one day. What’s more is that after a painstaking activation; I say this because after registering the product on Net 10’s website the phone still didn’t work. I had to call Net 10 from a land line so that a customer service representative could walk me through the process of putting in about 8 to 10 activation codes. After this, the phone couldn’t receive a signal… almost anywhere. In a very few locations we were able to make calls, but nowhere that it actually counted. It wouldn’t even work at our home whereas we’ve had AT&T and Verizon phones which work just fine. After calling Net 10 again, the customer service representative deduced that the produce was defective and that they would send a new phone. I was fine with this even putting aside that we’d had the produce well over a month and never got to use it. After repeating the home address to the representative three times, he still got it wrong. The package ended up at a FedEx several miles away and they couldn’t resend the package. So, I called Net 10 yet again to explain the problem to them. They said that they’d send another phone and never did. Instead they cancelled my service with them which is just fine as I would’ve done that anyway. The bottom line is that I gave this item three stars out of grace. I assume that if you get a working product there will be no problem, but be forewarned that costumer service is terrible should you have an actual problem.",0.0882296650717703

Oh, what I would give to have that phone back! My main complaint about this phone is that whoever designed it didn't give too much thought to usability/ease of use. In the Web design world, there is a general rule that a user should never have to click more than twice to get to any page on a site. The developer of this phone certainly did not have that rule in mind. I may be missing it, but I have not been able to find a speaker function on this phone. That means I can't drive while using it (no Bluetooth feature either) and I can't use the speaker when I am typing and making business calls. The phone often has to be reset because the clock stops or the date is wrong. The keyboard is also kind of weird. I thought you could use the shift button to switch from letters to numbers, but you can't. You have to click 123/sym, write out the number, and then go back to Abc/abc to write the rest of a message. This is a pain in the butt if you are trying to write several numbers in a message, as you have to keep switching between 123/sym and Abc/abc.

This is a Solid phone when it comes to net10 pay as you go phones and I have had a number of net10 phones over the years. I have seen some reviews on other prepaid phones and see the compliants about the browser speed. This is not an Android phone, if it's speed you want, buy an android, if it's just a basic Talk and text phone, then this is the type of phone to buy. This phone is a CDMA phone, it doesn't have a SIM card in it. I have read in an online forum that this phone actually uses the Verizon Towers so the signal is carried by them. I have had no signal problems thus far with this phone no matter where I have been in my area, though there are different factors that can come into play when it comes to cellphone signal strengths and weakness's. The keyboard on this phone is easy to navigate, I do wish they had made the keys just a tiny bit larger but it is not a deal breaker as I have adapted to it and it's not an issue for me. There are several other functions with this phone, one of my Favorties is the Tip calculator, I'm admittedly lousy at math, it's handy to have! There is a Memo pad, another handy tool to have to write a note to save, Remember, a note...not a book. It has a calendar as well as a calculator, it also has a camera, again, this is a prepaid phone camera, don't expect over the top pictures, but they afre not bad at all...for this type of phone.

I only use it for job/quick calls, I'm not much of a talker so I needed a prepaid phone.I bought a 200min card from NET10 the same day I got it and after a month, i still have 100+ min left. Buying this phone was definitely the right choice because it was cheap and I don't need a plan. It's a very light and has common cellphone features. The thing that I dislike, is that if you don't lock it, the browser button might get dialed by accident and then your minutes will just go. Happened to me twice but I quickly realized...i lost like 10min. It has a nice design and the camera is ok. This cellphone is nothing fancy but it does the job. The keypad buttons are kinda small but my hands are small so it's ok. Since I usually have the screen turned off, the battery lasts a lot of time. I never let it past 2 bars(out of 5) so I don't know how long it truly lasts. (I only remember charging it twice, when 3 bars left, ever since i got it a month ago)",0.089954648526077
B004GLQTG8,Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited	,Samsung,J. Brown,over all good phone but has some annoyances,"Ive owned this phone a little over a month now and for the most part do not regret buying it at current price, $9. However it Is not without A few aggravating features. The keyboard is small, as others have mentioned, so if you have large fingers it might not suit you. Also, there is now way of deactivating the browser that I am aware of and believe me I've looked for one. The browser is a one button push, and the only defense from doing this is to lock the keyboard by holding down the space button, which I forget to do sometimes. I just learned you can set the phone to lock the keyboard after a time of inactivity, in case you forget to lock it like I do. I was skeptical that this phone only charged you .25 minutes a text that another reviewer mentioned but sure enough it does, although I just noticed it also charges you 1 minute a call whether the person you are calling answers or not, which to the best of my knowledge doesn't happen with other net 10 phones. The mp3 player is a nice feature and can use up to 16 GB of ...which is quite a lot of music. Can't comment too much about the camera save for the fact you cannot zoom in after you snap a photo. Speaker is on par with other cheap phones. I would suggest this phone to anyone who has small fingers that likes to text, additionally they have a very similar phone at Kroger grocery store at the moment if you want to get an idea of the keyboard size. It is a Samsung with slightly different Model numbers. ThE 355c has a very slightly smaller keyboard than the one at Kroger.",0.0779679232804232
B004GLQTG8,Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited	,Samsung,MsTerry,"So good, I just ordered another R355C Net10 phone *** UPDATE ***","I lost my first one of these 2 days ago. I had it over a year. I researched other Net10 CDMA phones, as I prefer the Verizon network. I also have Net10 LG900g, which is GSM, on ATT. (That is also a good phone, by the way...but Verizon is better in our area). I ordered another one of the R355C, not only because of the price. The phone clarity was great, texting was easy for me, alarm clock worked fine, all the things I really needed it for. It has a good speakerphone. The camera is not that great, because there is no zoom, etc. No extra features. You can't even enlarge it at all when someone sends a pic message. Sometimes you have to ask them what it is a photo of. That is the state of this camera. (the LG900g has a nice camera). The browser, well, it's a browser. Not a smartphone. You definitely can check email and news, sports, whatever you want. It is slow, though, and not a computer experience. But it does work and you can indeed get your Internet fix if you have to. As a phone, as a texter, as an alarm clock, as a calculator, etc., it is wonderful. I was really sad to lose my first one and really happy to find another one here at this price. *** UPDATE **** The first one I received now was DOA. Not sure if battery or phone itself. Ordered a replacement for it, and now this one is shutting itself off after a few minutes. I need to return both. Should I try this model again? I don't know... I loved the one I lost...that is why I ordered another. So disappointing that these 2 replacements are not good. **** Second UPDATE **** The seller has graciously replaced this for me with a new one that works just great. Happy again.",0.2693573667711599
B004GLQTG8,Samsung R355C Net 10 Unlimited	,Samsung,Steve,"At last, good reception at a reasonable price!","I just wanted a basic phone, and this is it. Don't expect Internet access, Facebook, etc, with this thing. My friends mostly have phones costing 2-4 times this much per month (I use the $25/month 750 minute plan). But their phones don't work in buildings, elevators, on the subway, etc., and mine does. It seems that Net10 rents working wireless access from expensive companies and then sells it to us. I have purchased 3 of these phones. One was defective enough to return it, and a second one refuses to go into autolock mode, so I often find it browsing the net or writing its own text messages. To my knowledge it has never actually butt-dialed anyone. I can lock it by just holding down the spacebar, but I often forget. It has never managed to use up my minutes, anyway. A fourth Net10 phone also died before I started with these Samsungs. So why do I give them 5 stars? Because they are practically giving these phones away, and the per month charge is reasonable by US standards.The only reason I don't get yet another phone and dump my slightly defective one is that I'll have to type in about 300 digits to reprogram the new phone to take over my account. As far as usability, the phone is great. The keyboard is fine, even though the keys are tiny and I can barely see them without glasses, it is miles better than my previous 'cheap' phones, which cost much more than these. The menus are well organized, and I use the phone as my daily alarm as well. I like the ringtones selection.",0.1365656565656565

Did I mention the insane price, and that the phone arrived BRAND NEW, unopened, still in the box? It doesn't support Opera, but I was able to bookmark Google Mobile, which automatically gives her Google Maps (of course, she isn't going to need that yet, but it's nice to have, LOL). The phone also has a surprisingly decent mp3 player (you can upload music to it using a data cable), camera (no video, but your pics can be customized!), expandable memory and a standard 3.5mm headphone jack! You cannot watch YouTube videos, but you can use your mp3's for ringtones, something that too many contract (read: expensive) phones still won't allow you to do! The calls themselves come in clear. So far, we've had no problems with reception (everything works where we live, so we're probably not going to have too many issues with dropped calls). Best of all, my daughter LOVES her new phone.

Has good ringer volume, call quality and signal strength. Works off verizon as it is a CDMA. I don't take pics but this phone has a pretty decent camera. The mp3 player is above average sound quality. 3.5 headphone jack. Easy to lock keyboard by pressing space bar. Only thing I would change is the keys are a bit small but you get used to them. All in all, if you don't want to pay 80 or 90 bucks for a ""supposedly"" better phone with these features, this is the phone for you. I like it a lot. Have 2 of them. One for straight talk and the other for net 10. One more thing, this phone has the most economical texting plan, it's only 0.25 min per text. Other phones it's 0.50. For me that was a big selling point. For your interest: it was hard for me to pair the samsung r355c by bluetooth to transfer contacts.

Swenson,Decent phone for the money.,"First off you should know that this phone only charges .25 minutes per text received and send which is 50% of the regular Net10 phones and the main reason of my purchase, that being said... Important info you should know about this phone. Features: 1.3Mega Pixel camera, Long battery life, Quarty Keyboard My impressions: Keys are small but easy to type on, this phone does not support T9 word and calling numbers is slightly more annoying since the keys are smaller then most are used to. I can't comment on the browser features since for some reason the phone is roaming in the Wyoming area where I am located and it says data restriction 36 but from videos the browser is nothing special. It is also worth mentioning that you can record your own ringtones and transfer audio and images back and forth from your computer via a data cable or blue tooth adapter. Picture quality is better then my old 1.3MP camera which was a scoop but it's still nothing amazing, I'm sure everyone has seen what most cell phone pictures are like, and this phone is no exception, but still it is nice to have the feature. Also you can lock the keypad by pressing and holding the spacebar down. Features aren't great but you can get around 300 minutes or about 1200 text for 20$ per month on this phone which is very cheap for those of us who don't talk much.",0.2433921222810111

Their customer service reps lack any knowledge ,intelligence and diplomacy ! To keep this as brief as possible and not go on forever (which i truly could) I'll just say that in a single day I was accused of lieing about buying minutes or in this case posting my credit card for ""easy pay"" which it's not ! To having the phone disabled for 2 days, then having my phone number changed 3 times because their supposed simple number transfer process somehow couldn't be accomplished. Their techs had no reason for this until one of them suggested that the number had just expired! i had the same number for 7 years . Strange it expired the minute they tried to transfer it!

B004H23JXW,"Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)	",Samsung,Joanna D.,Lotsa phone for not a lotta moolah,"I don't use a smartphone much due to limited reception in my office area. But I like the features on a smartphone. So I didn't want to pay a lot or get stuck in a contract. I got this phone for about sixty on sale (wow, Amazon, that was pretty sweet!) and I'm delighted with it. It does more than my old Nokia X2 and I can always upgrade to full smartphone service if I need to. Right now, I have this on pay-as-you-go T-Mobile with my current SIM chip and don't do email or Web. I could change to PlatinumTel and even pay less on texting, and pay 10ct per 10MB of data--enough for email. I don't stream video or do internet on the phone--just need access to email on occasion. The setup was not bad, but took some time. I had the SIM chip (the T-Mobile) in the phone and was able to call and text. However, there was a bit of trouble with the reset--you hold the volume, the camera-on and the power buttons down simultaneously, and as soon as it vibrates, you release the power button but hold the rest until the REFORMAT screen appears. If you get the Download Mode Screen, you have to pop out the battery, power down (just powering down via the button doesn't work as it freezes at this point.) Then try again. I had to try quite a few times to get that screen up. The reformat is necessary for your SIM card to recognize the new phone. I was able to load the stored phone numbers from the previous phone, then access voicemail. The sound was a lot better than my previous phone and the operation on a touch screen is easy. I was not able to find a number of apps I wanted, as Windows Phone is not as popular as Android and that is not as popular as Apple. You'd think, with Windows OS being huge in computers, that there'd be more connectivity to phones, but it is definitely the 3rd best phone OS. Has a way to go. I was able to put it on my home WiFi and link the Bluetooth to my car handsfree system with no trouble at all. For the price, this is a great, functional phone. It isn't the be-all-end-all of phones, but for someone like me who is not a heavy cell phone user, it is delightful. I am very happy with it and I may either use my old Nokia as a backup emergency phone or donate it to those organizations who give phones to soldiers for calling home.",0.2483289527932384
B004H23JXW,"Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)	",Samsung,OSCAR E.,Overall a very good phone.,"Phone came unlocked and ready to use. I like windows as i find asy to use. This has windows 7.5. It takes great pictures, although the camera has a small dark spot and everytime I take a picture, there is a small dark spot in every photo, I have learned to live with it since I dont take much pictures. It has a durable and strong screen. After a year of using it, it started giving me problems were it would freeze and turn off on its own constantly for several weeks. I had to reset the phone to its original settings, I had to lost all my apps, photos, videos etc. Phone works fine now, but I am being more careful with what i download since I think that is what caused it to malfunction. I was able to restored all my contacts since they are link to my email account. Not the photos or apps, those I had to restore again. I am using the pohone with simple mobile, I was told by simple mobile that since the phone it is an AT&T brand, it is the reason I cannot send photos vis msn, because there is something the at&t brand had block and cannot be unlocked. That if I connect the phone with at&t I would be able to send photos via msn. For the same reason I cannot use the phone's integrated gps. In other words 5 functions that comes with the phone you cannot use them unless you connected with at&t. But you can work your way around it if you just download the right app. I use whatsapp to be able to send pictures and a gps app I downloaded.",0.1842532467532467
B004H23JXW,"Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)	",Samsung,D. Sharp,Really impressed with the phone and Windows 7.5,"I ordered the Samsung Focus I917 unlocked phone because the price was good and I wanted to test out Windows 7 OS. My carrier is Consumer Cellular and a 2nd sim card from them was free plus adding the phone to my account is just 10 dollars a month. I received the card and phone on the same day, inserted the card and voila, I was making calls. Before doing that I inserted a 32 gig microSD card so now I have a ton of memory to work with. Setting up wireless with my home network was a snap and using the USB connection to download the updates and apps I want was easy (GPS, Google stuff, etc.). I had to download those things because the phone is pre-loaded with AT&T proprietary apps and no AT&T account, no working apps. The nicest surprise I got was that Windows office is preloaded. I had to set up Skydrive on my both my home PC and the phone but now I can download and edit documents (word, excel, powerpoint) whenever I like. What wasn't nice was that cellular data connection wasn't working. At first I was blaming it on the phone not being unlocked but that wasn't the case, a call to Consumer Cellular support and 5 minutes later I was using my cellular data connection to the web. So, bottom line: its not going to be perfectly set up out of the box and may require working with your carrier service but once its set up, its great. If you have to consult with your cellular carrier you'll need your IMEI number. It'll speed things up if you already have it and you can get it by dialing *#06# on your phone and writing down the number for their use. Oh, you need to install ZUNE onto your PC, I'm not particularly impressed with it but its no big deal, I only use it to sync music anyway.",0.251984126984127
B004H23JXW,"Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)	",Samsung,Jane,Good Start,"If you are wanting to give a Windows smart phone a try this phone I highly recommend it. It's a nice solid phone. I've had mine for 4 months and I'm still pretty happy with it. The back is plastic with good looking pinstripes and some might complain that adding a certain cheapness to it but I disagree. It still looks great and very easy to remove if necessary and if made from metal would only increase overall weight and probably be a little trickier to remove having to line up slots just right. As it is it snaps off and on with ease. The overall feel is good and solid with nice curved edges making it a good looking phone as well. The 5 mega-pixel camera takes good pics too. The Super-Amoled touchscreen is great and easy to see in almost all light conditions even under a bright sun. The Windows os; as far as I can tell I like it. I can't comment on the Android or ios as I haven't used them. I can only say that what I've read is that Android is a mess. It is by far the most popular and looks like it will be for sometime. It appears that Google has very low if any standards in place for phone manufactures. Many of them with the hardware needed to fully run Android. Windows has placed standards on how Windows phones should be made so they run smoothly with little or no issues and at the same time keeping requirements at a level to keep accessible to most consumers. Most comments I've read about I phones is that while at one time cutting edge are not anymore as their platform is getting stale, have run out of ideas, running on brand only. Windows was designed with the user in mind to have an interface easy and intuitive to use and customizable enough for almost everyone and have become the one with the ideas now. There are some caveats I'd like to point out. The button placement could be better. The lock-screen button is directly opposite of the volume and too easy to press when trying to adjust volume. The light sensor works and locks the screen when making a phone call but not when putting it in a pocket or purse. It won't automatically lock itself leading to pocket calls, pictures of your pocket and voice commands. The only way to prevent this is to remember to press the lock-screen button. One of my fears is this button wearing out fast from having to use it so much. Most of these phones will be AT&T phones so be prepared. They have Windows 7.5 and no plan or talk to release any update. There are several work-arounds to this. One being to plug phone in to computer, start the Zune software, click on phone update under the settings then unplug the internet connection from the computer after 2 or 3 seconds. It's real tricky to say the least and one that I couldn't ever get to work. There is a cab file to download on your computer and do it that way. The easiest is an application called seveneighter that will do the whole thing for you. I used that method a month ago without any problems. I recommend going to the windowsphone subreddit for any help you might need. Samsung has a user manual available on their website with many tips and information not available anywhere else. Windowsphonehacker.com has the seveneighter file that I mentioned to update your phone with great help articles as well.",0.2602103174603174
B004H23JXW,"Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)	",Samsung,daniel_leavitt2000,A great travel and backup phone,"I have owned a Samsung Focus for two and a half years now. It was my primary phone until the Lumia 920 came out in November. Since then, I keep my Focus around when I travel out of the country and in situations where I would not want my primary phone to get lost or damaged. My first Focus lasted over 18 months, surviving frequent drops, tosses, pockets with keys, heavy rain and other disasters. This is much better than any cell phone I had used up until that point. I finally managed to crack the screen dropping down some cement steps. I replaced it with an HTC Surround, which barely lasted 4 months under the same conditions. After the HTC phone died, I went and got a new unlocked Focus on Amazon. Though tough, the phone is a finger print magnet. It also feels really cheap and lightweight. For all their cool kit inside, Samsung never produced a phone that looks and feels as expensive as it is. The hardware on the phone was great in 2010, and still feels pretty good today. The AMOLED screen is bright and very vibrant but a little pixelated. The Sound is pretty good. The phone uses NAND memory, which is faster than many SD card based phones. There is an expandable SD card slot (the only Windows Phone 7 device to have one), and the removable battery is a huge plus when traveling. Tinkerers will like the Focus too. That SD card comes in handy, and the unlocked boot loader allows you to flash custom Windows Phone ROMs. You won't be getting Windows Phone 8, but you can flash to 7.8, however. Right now, there are only a few games and apps that require WP8 (Temple Run, Modern Combat 4 are two examples). At $100, this phone is less than half the cost of a budget Lumia 520. The phone is certainly cannot keep up with high end phones today, but it does not feel slow or obsolete like Android phones from 2010.",0.1642586117586117

The zune marketplace for music and bing search that is really good, you can search for songs even if you don't know the names. Not everything is perfect battery life is only for one day, you have to charge it everyday. You don't have skype and sugarsync apps but they said they are coming soon. The bad part of Windows Phone 7.5 is that you need to integrate the memory card to the file system. Its not hot swap and also you cant transfer files with the memory card because it gets formatted during the integration process. The The only way to transfer files to the phone is by mail or skydrive. With the Focus you don't get the Hotspot feature.

B004H23JXW,"Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)	",Samsung,Rosemary R.,Disappointed with phone and Microsoft,"Returned this item for a refund, not only because it was defective, but poorly designed as well (despite what the experts say) and because the Microsoft 30-day free music download appears to be a deliberate scam. As for the phone, the exterior Power On and Camera On buttons sometimes did not work. The touchscreen button for taking photos sometimes did not work. When positioning the camera lens, the screen constantly switches to a non-camera app, forcing you to start all over. The onscreen keyboard is infinitesimally small, so mistakes are a constant. As for the operating software, you cannot download the current Windows 8, but are stuck with Windows 7. When I downloaded and started playing music (courtesy of the so-called free trial), the phone shut down but kept playing the songs, so I had to remove and re-insert the battery to regain control of the device. When charging the device, the charge indicator screen never seemed to be the same one twice, and sometimes there was no indication at all of anything going on. (I eventually discovered that there's a little pull-down indicator at the top of the screen, but initially thought the battery or the charger did not work.) As for that free music trial, I clicked the ""Cancel this subscription"" on the Zune Marketplace screen, after connecting the device to my desktop computer. No sweat right? Wrong. This just takes you to Microsoft XBox login screen. After entering your password, MS says it still needs to ""verify"" who you are by sending a code to your email address. After retrieving and entering that, you select ""Account"", only to find that there is no cancel option anywhere to be found. The long, convoluted instructions for canceling provided by MS explain that you have to change your payment method first, although this guide doesn't correspond to the screens you actually see. At any rate, after changing away from the automatic renewal option as instructed, there is no message indicating the trial is cancelled and you're not allowed to remove your credit card info from the system. On another screen, you're instructed to call XBox to cancel a subscription. Going down this new rabbit hole, you're instructed to fill out a page with your request and provide your phone number so MS can call you in 2 minutes. But after you submit the request, you get an error message saying it didn't work and you should try again later. Boy, last time I check, this sort of con game involving interstate commerce was outlawed by the FTC. The only recourse seems to be waiting for the charge to show up on the credit card and disputing it through your bank.",0.0105179542679542

HOWEVER, when I received the phone and proceded to update, it wouldn't cooperate i researched the issue on the internet, and it seems to be a common problem turns out that my phone had demo firmware on it well, instead of contacting the seller and going through that mess, i found the retail ROM online. i ended up using a rom sender and switched the demo with the retail, and it updated right away. i can't say if the seller was aware of the demo firmware being on the phone, but be careful if your phone turns the screen on by itself every couple of minutes, chances are you have a demo model. I decided to put a custom rom on it, and it is the best phone I have ever had if you want a custom rom, use keywords ""dark forces team"" or ""voluptuary"" i have voluptuary's on mine. definitely a good phone for the money, and wp7 is awesome!!!",0.3579081632653061

I researched the phone to double check it is compatible with AT&T's GoPhone Prepaid program and sure enough it is (AT&T sell this phone in their GoPhone section only at $499). The phone was delivered the day after in good condition and it was sold by BLUTEKUSA. The phone looks new and has no noticeable fingerprints or marks that would indicate it's been used, although the box it came in was obviously opened before. It came with the phone, charger, and a pair of headphones. The Samsung Focus is pretty easy to set up. It asks for date and time as well as a Windows Live ID which can be synced with later if so desired. The screen is beautiful, Super AMOLED making the display rich in brightness and color. There are physical buttons for the Power button, Camera, and Volume Control. It's plastic, so the phone is pretty light, although to the point where one might consider it cheap. The back is a thing plastic case that snaps onto the phone. Taking off the back is a bit on the scary side as I felt I might have snapped it the few times I tried. Overall the phone is a nice build just not one that screams high quality. The Camera takes really good pictures and I was impressed with the 720p video recording as well. Again, not high-end, but it's above average nonetheless. I updated the Samsung Focus to Windows Mango and the software is fantastic. The interface is easy on the eyes and is smooth. I have not seen any hiccups on this phone even though it only comes with 512mb ram, although that seems to be a restriction from Microsoft. To me, it has just as much polish as iOS (the operating system that the iPhone/iPad run) although it lacks a lot of the customization of Android (not really missing it). It integrates Facebook and other social network clients into one area and so far I love it. The keyboard is easy to use as well and have not had any trouble misspelling words. *Edit* Fixed problem with the SIM Card. This phone is excellent.

Disconnected phone, turned on and off several times, took battery on and off several times, couldn't unfreeze it. This didn't come with a printed manual either, so had to download that.

But the second time I bought the phone was even worst, the phone was sold directly by Amazon and it came with an Scratched Screen Protector.

I don't have a replacement for the screen proctector yet, so I haven't removed it yet.... My biggest concern is that the Screen may be also scratched.

I particularly love the People hub where you can see all your contacts, social networks and recent communications in one view. However, in a market increasingly dominated by iOS and Android, Microsoft is finding it difficult to attract developers for many apps.

I am a gadget freak who enjoys using different devices with no fanboy-like attachment.

It is very fast and has a great interface. Beware though it won't work with the tmobile sim from Straight Talk. After hours upon hours of sites forums and Straight Talk people I came to realize it just doesn't have the Apn options to make the data work for some weird reason. This phone only gives the option of APN, Username, Password, Proxy server and Proxy port. It seems now days you need more options like: MMSC MMS MCC MNC The later phones like the Focus S and Focus 2 might not have these options but another choice is downloading ""Wireless Manager"" app from the Samsung Zone, yet for this model it is not an option. I heard the newer ones had this option but thats up to you to find out I guess. The app suggests you get Network Profile which only gives you the options between ATT and TMOBILE. I guess if you go directly through TMOBILE you will have greater success but the SIM through straight talk will lead to hours of frustration. Anyway hope this helped and hey if you find away for this model to work let me know.

Very good keyboard it is amazing. I had the HTC aria so the size difference felt so good in my hands, very tactile and the auto correct is really good it does its job!! It actually helps u type unlike some phones. The screen is astonishing, it pops out with such vibrant colors u feel like the picture is right in front of you. Video is also really good, I'd say it is equal to the iPhones except this has more vibrant colors, im in high school so I have alot of essays tht need to be typed and if my computer is ever being used I can type it up on this just as easy with Microsoft word. Xbox live is really good on this phone I can message my friends some games in the marketplaces gives you gamerscore!! On a side note if ur into minecraft their is a really good mobile alternative on here called survivalcraft. The marketplace has about 80,000 apps/games which is good enough for me even though it's about 400,000 less than android and iOS it has everything you need. As soon as I got my phone in the mail I updates it to windows phone mango and it is such a cleaner interface than android and it is alot better to look at than iOS. I was worried upgrading from 7 to mango would slow the phone but it's 1 GHz processor does the job amazingly! If ur into Facebook, twitter, windows live this phone is deff the best choice because it syncs everyone on ur friends list into ur phone and gives all their contact info they have available! I have 60-80 contacts in my last phone but when I synced Facebook (only social network I use) I have 700 some contacts! Also the pictures hub syncs all Facebook pics very neatly in with ur other photos. Talking about photos the camera is great its 5mp with 720p HD recording, my aria had 3.2mp with vga recording the difference was astonishing! It takes better pictures than the iPhone 4 in my opinion (not the 4s). Now the bad the battery life is mediocre I get about 7-8 hours of light use but I usually charge my phone after I get back from school around 2:30 p.m. I unplug it around 6:30 to start the day. But if I stay after school for anything I bring my charger because my phone will not last through that extra 2-3 hours. The other thing I dislike is its full plastic!! It is very lightweight, but it feels sort of flimsy and the plastic scratches easy, so I got a case which I recommend u get this case 2 its on amazon type in Samsung Focus Incipio Feather Case and I'll find it its about $15-$20 but it's worth it.

Period.,"I've been using the Focus for about three months now and it's honestly by far the best phone I've ever owned. The screen is gorgeous, the WP7 OS is responsive and intuitive, and most of all it actually works as a phone! As a previous dedicated Iphone owner, I can say that I have absolutely no regrets in switching, and I can see the jealousy of my family (who are still Apple nuts) whenever I let them mess around with the interface. The only cons I can put against it are that it only comes with 8 gigs initially (which is just ridiculously low these days), but I stuck another 16 in with an sd card I had lying around. Some people seem to be having an issue with not having their cards work, but I've never had a problem. Also-and this is incredibly minor-there's no gapless playback on the Zune software. I know only about 5 people will actually care (or even notice), but it's slightly irritating at times. In it's current state, I would already put the Focus and WP7 at the cream of the mobile crop, but with the Mango update coming in a week or two, I really can't see any other OS coming near to holding a candle to it. A lot of people are still understandably skeptical due to Microsoft's less than stalwart track record with mobile devices, but WP7 fixes every issue of the past and does what Apple has quit doing-innovating.",0.0684027777777777

However, the fact that you have to use Zune to sync music and media onto the device is really dumb. I would prefer just dragging my mp3s from PC to a file folder. Also, because this phone is single core, it tends to crash a lot and as time goes by, crash incidents increase. It will really start to become aggravating. When a text is sent, sometimes you will have to restart the phone (taking the battery out) only to retype what you wanted to send because the phone cpu locks as you send the message. If you want to be completely bug free and crash free, avoid this phone. Get an iPhone or something with dual or more cores.

B004H23JXW,"Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)	",Samsung,Ofer,A hidden gem,"I owned a top-notch Android device for a while, but I wasn't a big fan of the clutter - the speed issues for a phone which was expensive at the time, the speculation over whether i'll get that upcoming update or whether my carrier will decide I don't really need it, installing ROMs to make it run better. Android, for me, felt like a mess. So I looked for something simple and powerful. It was either a Windows phone or an iPhone. The iPhone had a high price tag, and the Windows phone seemed... different. I thought i'd give it a go. that was a great decision. Windows phone is fast, elegant, has loads of content and it's just fun to use. No hassle, has everything I want - a great music experience, a fast browser, great apps and games and Facebook integration. The Samsung focus is a good piece of hardware: the screen has vibrant colors, the speakerphone is very strong and clear, it's fast and its design is both elegant and stylish. My beef with this phone has to do with its SD card slot. It was advertised as having expandable memory, but SD cards seem to malfunction when used. No official SD card is available for this smartphone, so it's basically a moot feature. Overall, this is a wonderful smartphone and I would highly recommend buying it. With its current price tag, it's a real steal.",0.3191666666666666
B004H23JXW,"Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)	",Samsung,Blaxe,Samsung Focus,"I just got this phone 2 weeks ago for my parents and I wanted to compare it to the iPhone 4 which I personally use. I disagree with the other reviewers here who say that the phone is better than the iphone 4. Here are the reasons why: The screen The iPhone has a much higher resolution display at 960/640 packed in a 3.5 inch screen. The Focus has a 800/480 screen in a 4 inch display. Some people will say ""4 inches is definitely better than 3.5 inch"" but it has less pixels than the iPhone and the pixels are spaced farther apart thanks to the bigger screen. What does that mean? Images and text look a lot less sharp on the focus compared to the iPhone. After using the iPhone, I don't think I can ever accept anything less in terms of screen quality. But if videos are all you watch, then you'll probably enjoy the focus more. Functionality The apps on the iPhone are tremendous, and I am able to use it for whatever purpose that I can imagine be it calculations, looking up drugs, booking my vacation, etc. I work in the healthcare setting and robust medical apps like medscape and epocrates are scarce on the windows platform. I also like to use google voice to text via 3G, and there's no official google app for this phone. There's virtually no incentive for google to develop an app for this phone since only 1-2% of the smartphone population has windows phones. App developers probably have the same view. So unless you're just into posting your status on facebook (the integration which is nice btw), this phone may not be able to accomplish many tasks in your life. Not yet anyway... Camera: With skype around the corner for the windows platform, it will suck since the focus lacks a front facing camera. The iPhone has one. So you'll be limited to voice calling only. Experience The experience on both phones is different, but very nice. None of the phones are plagued by any jittery behaviour or crashes. I think both phones are miles ahead of android in terms of having an overall smooth experience. It is for this reason that I think microsoft has something truly amazing and will not send windows phone to the trash can. I admit, the tile system of windows is kind of strange at first glance and may hamper adoption of the platform because one does not see conventional ""icons."" But when Windows 8 comes out for the PC and more and more people are exposed to the metro interface on their notebooks, a windows phone won't seem so alien anymore and may speed up its success in terms of app development. Bottom line: I think it's safe to say that this phone is a long term investment since many great apps on iOS and android aren't available yet. That's the only thing holding windows phones back. You can easily overlook the other shortcomings since this phone is so cheap for being unlocked, which is the reason why I got it for my parents.",0.2126570415400203

Since you mentioned that you already renamed your account, I would recommend that you change your Windows Live ID after 6 months and see if you would encounter any error message. My Response: Wow, that's stupid! Why does it let you change it to begin with? From reading other posts and forums it sounds like this is a big issue. People are changing it not knowing it'll screw up their windows phone. What's the benefit to Microsoft for waiting 6 months to let a Windows Phone owner change their ID back to the previous ID after a screw up? It's not like you guys informed us of this issue. If I've got to wait 6 months to get my phone syncing again, I'm going to drop this Windows Phone for another phone ops at the end of my contract in 4 months. Tech Response: Although I really want to help you with this issue, the system is desgined to have a waiting period for Windows Live ID that has been changed.

The only thing that could be better would be the availibility of phone settings. I think this is a limitation of the Windows Phone 7 O.S. On the one hand, since there are few settings, it is easy to set up. On the other hand, since there are few settings, you can not pick and choose when to use your data plan versus your WIFI during a specific action. It is on or off for WIFI, DATA, BLUETOOTH, AIRPLANE MODE. (My old Nokia had the ability to ask which network to use for every connection, which I liked.) While it defaults to WIFI when WIFI is present, it turns off WIFI in sleep mode to conserve battery life. I was kind of shocked to find that I used up 10 MB one night while I was asleep. A quick search finds this as a common complaint. I am on AT&T's Pay-As-You-Go plan, 10 cents per minute and I prepay for data, $5 for 10MB, $10 for 100MB, and $25 for 500MB. What I do is to pay $5.00 per month for the data plan, which rolls over my available data. This works out to about $100 every 6 months or so. There were no problems whatsover getting this phone up and running. It connects nicely with Microsoft's Skydrive. You can enter all of your contacts and calendar entries in Hotmail, and it syncs nicely with your phone, to give you a constant backup. Nothing bad to say, it looks great, there are plenty of apps available, and overall, it's a winner. Edit: There is one thing I'm not used to. There are no reminders for missed calls or text messages.

Window Apps are far fewer than android market could offer. The phone works better with AT&T even though unlocked. Every time you put a Tmobile SIM card, you need to factory reset the phone.

B004H23JXW,"Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)	",Samsung,R.S.,"Windows Phone 7 is great, Samsung Focus is solid, DOES come unlocked, but has suspicious packaging","Straight from the vendor the phone is, in fact, unlocked (we use it on T-Mobile, but it should work with any GSM network with a SIM card, but NOT Verizon or Sprint or CDMA networks). This is our second Samsung Focus (the first was directly through Amazonwireless) and we love this phone! AT&T has dropped the ball big-time on updates, however, and you can only upgrade it to WP 7.5 Mango. There are several security/bug fix updates in between WP 7.5 and 7.8 that AT&T will not allow Microsoft to push to your phone, but overall this is a great entry-level smart phone and you simply cannot beat the price now that it has been out a couple of years. Since the phone is branded to AT&T (even though it is unlocked and can be used on any GSM network) you will simply not be able to get any updates on this phone until AT&T decides to bless you with them (which in all likelihood based on their history, is NEVER). Also, the box that the phone came in was sealed, but did not have ""Samsung"" or ""AT&T"" anywhere on the box except a printed out sticker. The original Focus I got from Amazonwireless directly, had a normal flashy orange AT&T box with Samsung written all over it. The product manual inside of this new unlocked phone's box also suspiciously does not say Samsung or AT&T on it. To make matters worse, the little info sticker with the serial numbers on it below the battery does NOT say Samsung on it (unlike our first Samsung Focus directly from Amazonwireless did). When I first got the package, it screamed COUNTERFEIT to me. ***see update below*** But upon opening it, the phone appears to be constructed the same. I powered on and set up the phone and then installed a Benchmark app on it, and it performs the same as my original Focus does. To top it off, I called Samsung directly and told them about my concerns. After describing everything to them and even giving them my phone's IMEI number (serial number), they assured me that it was a genuine Samsung product (but the representative had no explanation for why the packaging looked so suspicious). In any event, the phone itself is a solid 5 stars. AT&T gets 1 star for neglecting their customers by not allowing security and bug fixes on phones they offer (which is partially why we switched carriers in the first place). But because of the update issue and the unusual packaging, I dinged the phone down to 4 stars. But like I said, for an entry-level smart phone WITHOUT extending your contract, you simply cannot beat the price, and the whole Windows Phone system is a wonderfully refreshing alternative to Android and Apple (IMHO). ***update*** I received the Focus and it appeared to work perfectly at the time I wrote the original review, but then when we tried to take a picture with the phone a week into owning it, there was a large yellow-discolored area in the center of the screen as if someone tried to take a picture of the sun or something insane like that and burned out the image sensor. That got me thinking that perhaps the phone was refurbished rather than brand new (which might also explain the knock-off looking non-Samsung box). I did some reasearch and have come to the conclusion that I almost certainly received a refurbished phone (an internet search on how to spot refurbished phones was VERY helpful). The seller had good customer service though and sent us a label to send back the defective phone and sent another ""new"" one at no charge. This ""new"" phone was actually in the factory Samsung box this time. However, the box was scratched and the phone itself also had other tell-tale signs of being refurbished (although if I hadn't researched the topic it would have appeared brand new to me). This time around, however, I ran diagnostics on the phone the moment I opened the box and set up the OS and everything seems to be working perfectly. A final follow-up question to the seller about whether they might be getting supplied with refurbished phones instead of ""new"" phones from their supplier has so far gone unanswered, but I'm almost positive that's what is happening here. I can't be too mad because the price we paid for the supposedly ""new"" phone was actually less than other sellers were charging for a refurbished phone, but a little bit of honesty here would be nice. In any event, I encourage you to research how to spot a refurbished phone on the interet for more information. In my non-expert opinion, in retrospect, I highly doubt any carrier-branded phone (i.e. with AT&T logo on the front) can come factory unlocked. So if you see a listing for ""unlocked"" and ""new"" in the same sentence, I personally doubt the accuracy of that listing and urge you to contact the seller in advance to double check. When phones come back from the factory after service work, or they get refurbished to be resold, it is a well-documented fact that they are usually unlocked at THAT point. So be forewarned, if a carrier-branded phone is ""new"" it is most likely locked, and if a carrier-branded phone is unlocked, it is most likely not new. I have lowered the rating down to 3 stars due to what I think is likely inaccurate marketing.",0.100634108946609

All in all it's a very nice interface. I prefer over Apple and Droid. The phone itself is great. Looks nice, fast, expandable memory, the camera takes a decent picture and battery life is quite good. The apps selection is okay but their interface is quite different from their Droid and Apple counter parts. Yelp for example is bizarre to use when compared to the latest version on Apple or Droid. It uses a Windows phone style interface which has a different screen flow. I don't think 3rd party apps have a good grasp on how to develop for this platform. I will say the app selection is improving though. If you love apps I'd probably skip this phone. If you need a phone for email and Facebook this phone will work very well for you. Bing maps works well in the US but not as well in Canada as Google maps. Still it is very good when compared to Apple's new map app. Tip: Make sure when you get the phone update the OS right away.

I decided to take the plunge with this little gem. Upon receiving the phone the packaging was no frills, and made me nervous. Before running the phone I charged the battery and installed an additional 8gb micro sd card I got for 19.99 (PNY MicroSD) because in the documentation WP7 takes over the SD card for good! The operating system takes up about 1.2 GB so keep that in mind. I love the fact that I can delete the ATT default applications since I am on TMobile pre-paid (50$ unlimited). Yes it is only limited to 2G (edge) speed. Updating the phones software was the only difficulty I had. While updating I got a backup error causing it to not update. I believe it was the front USB port I was using on my computer but at the same time I used a different Micro USB cable from my mytouch and plugged it in a usb port in the back of my computer. Once I did that I was able to apply the 2 updates through the Zune software (required) Anyway, setting up the phone was easy enough.

If you are looking for something more fully fleshed out I would recommend either the latest Android or iPhone. I did notice some glaring omission/annoyance from this OS and Windows Phone 8 so I'll list the positive and the negatives below. Pros: 1. relatively cheap smart phone 2. Upgradable to Windows Phone 7.5 maybe eventually 7.8 3. Light weight 4. Good wifi reception Cons: 1. Cannot block calls/numbers. (I can't understand why this basic feature isn't present. It's on my 3yr old dumb candy bar phone and yet there's no way to do this either under Windows phone OS or apps. 2. Cannot customize alerts with SMS/MMS or voicemails 3. Battery is weak. A fully charge battery with battery saver feature turned on and in idle mode will last a little over 2 days. Those are pretty much my take on the phone.",0.2246496924128502

No, that is not an exaggeration. You see, a few months into ownership, this phone would prompt you to turn it off Randomly, without any contact to the power button. Sometimes while you aren't doing anything. Sometimes while the screen is locked. Reject it/Swiping away cause it to stall. Turning it off results in the same lack of turning on. Sure, you'll be able to turn it on. But it crashes before actually turning on. If you take the battery out, and put it back in, it will immediately start trying to turn on. It should not do this. When you put the battery in normally, it stays off until you power it on. Thus, it stalls again. My guess is your attempts to start it restart after doing this as well, because it seems to take a certain number of trys to get it to run. When its on the charger, the 3 bottom buttons lose functionality. You need those to do just about everything. You can hold the back arrow to access previous things you've been doing, but not while connected. you'll only get a single press. and then you have to wait 5 seconds to get another. Imagine trying to watch Netflix and someone texts you. You can only get that message shortcut if you do it RIGHT THEN. if you don't, you have to the app. but then with the time it takes you to get back to Netflix, you have another text. STILL RUNNING 7.5. STILL WAITING ON 7.8. THIS IS MARCH OF 2014, CLOSE TO APRIL. Great otherwise when it works. Better sound quality than a lot of other 7.5 devices.",0.114345238095238

It was a good value and connected to AT&T very easily. I am using a $25/mo. off contract plan that allows unlimited texting and 250 minutes a month. The wifi connections have been very solid, so I am happy with that I decided to save 30 dollars a month while still getting the majority of the functionality I was looking for. Design: 4/5 Overall I like the design. I would have liked it to be made out of more durable materials, but it certainly looks good. The front is a solid flat surface and the back is grayish with pin-striping that really is well done. The back is curved slightly, which helps to prevent it from being too slippery as it could be, with it being made out of smooth glossy plastic. The screen is very bright, but is made of plastic, so it could easily get scratched. Performance: 4/5 It is fast enough. Downloads don't take long, and I have never seen a stutter. It upgraded to Mango without any issues using the Zune software I already had on my laptop. It plays Netflix perfectly with no noticeable pixelation or lag. It could load a couple of things faster, but overall load speeds are quite decent. The OS masks any slowdowns it might have by using fanciful transition effects. Voice quality has been good, but there have been reports of echoing from people on the other end of the calls. Value: 5/5 At $240 I will save $200 or more during my first year on AT&T, and $400 or more during my second year. I call that value.",0.2937843876553555

B004H23JXW,"Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)	",Samsung,R. Novak,"Awesome OS, Great Phone, Could Be More Rugged","I'd really been looking forward to an escape from the Android OS and all the problems I had with it in the year since I began using my Samsung SG-I9000. Apple's iPhone was tempting because of its functionality, but it was so overly-hyped and trendy I had many second thoughts about it. I've used an iPhone here and there before and it was simple, but just didn't feel like something I wanted in the long-term. Windows Phone was already on the scene but there were no stores selling them at the time where I live, so after reading review after review, I decided to take a leap of faith and grab the Samsung I917, aka the Focus. The GOOD: First, the operating system is head, shoulders, torso, hips, thighs, knees, calves and ankles above anything else on the market. It's just so simple and intuitive, not to mention beautiful. And unlike Android, it's the exact same from device to device, so the user experience is consistent. Zune integration is beautiful. I can sync all my Zune music on my computer to my phone either by plugging in or over a wi-fi connection. I can also download from the marketplace over the air and then sync back to my computer next time I connect. The People tab is great because it lets me see what all my contacts are doing over social networks all in one place. The phone is also physically beautiful. I especially like the pinstriped back of the case. The device is thin and light and quick (after all, it's basically a first-gen Galaxy S). The BAD: The phone is pretty plasticy, and while it's actually pretty tough, I would really like to see Samsung put out a ""pro"" version made of duraluminum, like their Series 9 laptops are made of. I'm pretty rough on my phones, watches, etc, so I always appreciate rugged versions of products when applicable. The build quality is good but it just doesn't feel overly tough to me, which is the basis of my 4-star rating. The UGLY: Windows Phone marketshare. Seriously, this OS is so amazing, so beautiful, and so simple to use, this should have been 15% - 20% by now in my opinion. Give this phone a chance folks, you'll be glad you did. It's different, it's beautiful, and it's going to be around for a long time.",0.1951609114399811

In short, I am very happy with my purchase. I was under the false impression that smart phones were very expensive and the data packages were still $20-25 extra a month. You CAN turn data on this phone OFF (Settings, Cellular, Data Connection) and just use the WI-FI but I chose to have a package that allows me some browsing at only $10 extra a month. This is with T-mobile. This phone does not come with a computer cord, and there is already an update available for it, so I strongly recommend purchasing a USB cable for it so you can update immediately. WITHOUT THE UPDATE, YOU CAN'T ACCESS APPS. The updates are free. I also could not get picture messages without downloading the app called Network Profile which is also a free app. Now that the apps and picture messages are working, I can safely say it is a very nice phone. After the update you can also voice text, which is the only thing I wished this phone had prior to me downloading the update. Now it does. This is a Windows operating system which means only Windows apps are available. You can't get Instagram, Snapchat, or a lot of other popular ones. When an app is created it's almost always made for Apple or Android products first, and Blackberry and Windows devices later, if at all. So that kind of sucks. The price on this phone tends to fluctuate. I paid $135 and a week later my sister paid $98.",0.1801047619047619

No forward facing camera isn't a deal breaker for me, because If I wanted to video chat, I'll just do that at home on my computer (when I have combed hair. lol..) I've had windows phones since the first windows mobile os (which wasn't good). Now they have Windows Phone OS; And microsoft has learned from old mistakes. Since the Mango update Windows phone is awesome. I love that It has office in the phone. This feels like a real work phone. The Iphone felt like, well an Ipod with a phone built in. I also love that I was able to add a 32gb SD card to up the memory. (It now has 36.6gbs free.) That means If I so please I can download movies or Xbox live games. :-) I was spazzing out on mirrors edge yesterday with the Focus. :-) & the hd video may be only 720p but it's good enough to make quality youtube videos. And it's flash is better than the Iphones flash. My choices were pay $$$$ for a new unlocked Iphone or unlocked Android or unlocked Blackberry, settle for a cheaper windows phone that only has 8gbs of rom, or get this older focus and upgrade it with the SD card. For less than the price of a used Iphone 3g, I got a factory unlocked phone that can do all the same things, but adds microsoft office, an hd camcorder, and the biggest factor is that this phone asks before distributing all your private user information. Originally I was onboard for an android, then the same day I was going to get one, a consumer watchdog group out of Santa Monica California issued a request to the US Attorney asking that Google and Apple be sued for billions of dollars due to their letting app developers access all personal data on people's phones. That, infact, is how many stalkers were invading celebrity cellphones. I'm not so worried about stalkers, but I don't like the thought of someone being able to hack my info just because I accidentally installed a shady app instead of angry birds. (and by the way even angry birds gets all your private info sent to them via Android & Iphone.) If you want to be in with the cool people and don't care about privacy issues or budget, go for an Iphone or an Android phone. If you want a phone that will do all the same things but won't give free reign to any app developer that wants to hack your phone, and you want to pay $$$ less for an unlocked phone; The Focus is a very good choice. Just remember to get the right SD card. Many don't work, and because people wouldn't read and research to get the right one, many people complained that they couldn't get it working right. Also many people didn't read the fact that the SD card intigrates into the OS, and therefore can not be removed or used to transfere files once it has been intigrated with the phone. Due to so many complaints by people that just don't bother to read the directions, they stopped putting the upgrade slot on the newer phones. That means the newer ones might have a better processor, but you have to go up to the most expensive models to even compete with the space you can have on this Focus i917. I may get another for my lady and retire her no privacy having Iphone. She already wants to trade. :-) Update May 1st, 2013: One month on and using the phone feels totally natural now. I have not lost any calls, had any crashes, or lost any data. Oh and I did replace her Iphone. She loves her Samsung Focus. Before she wouldn't risk her Iphone: she would switch sims and use a cheap flip phone if for example: we went to the beach or were going to ride on a boat or had an amusement park day. But now she uses her Iphone for the beach, flip phone is finally retired, and the Focus is protected & adorned. (^_^) .",0.2370379907448873

I did some online checking but was unable to determine if cell-to-ear volume was a specific model weakness. Three points from my ordering experience: 1) check the vendor's return policy before purchasing; 2) when you receive the order check the phone properties first--it's easy to become enchanted with smartphones to the point of overlooking the basic on ear use; 3) buyers should reflect on the liklihood that any unlocked cell listed is actually new. To date I've found my second phone to be sleek, with the Windows 7 system impressive. Apps are increasingly available and diverse, not the walled garden of Iphone. Of contacting Samsung: dealing with customer support (Samsung or any other) be aware you likely will interact with a rep--working from a script--who has no cellular expertise. Check the manual carefully before entering the customer service ordeal. You'll be directed through two corrections, soft reset, and if the problem remains, hard reset. (You can find both on any model via web search). If these two corrections fail you're at the point of sending the phone in for repair or returning to seller. If you do need to contact Samsung, I found Facebook easier than web site contact. Twitter is also an option. Sept. 2016 update: I'm getting ready to upgrade from the i917.

I did alot of research and decided on the windows phone based on the occasional clunkiness of android. Though I really like the iphone, it's just too muchh $$ and a contract. We recieved the phone in new condition and at first having played around with it a little I really didnt like it that much. I updated to Mango which is cool, but it really took a week of playing with it to decide it really is a great phone. My wife uses her camera alot, and this one has a very good camera. I went out the other night and took some pics outside in the pitch black, I couldnt see what I was aiming at until the flash went off, but the pics were really good. Today we went to the beach as there was a big storm and we took pics side by side and the focus produced much better pics than my nexus one. There are a few things that I like better about android for sure. Live wallpapers for one, and the stupid colored tiles on windows. I mean really, gee I get to pick my color for by big tiles? thats it? I was hoping these ""live"" tiles would be like customizable to a much greater extent then they are. The other thing I dont like is the app store. It's niether layed out as well, nor does it have that many apps compared to the compitition. So, why five stars? well really it's about the phone. The screen is great, it's very responsive, excellent camera, great call or signal strength and the battery for us has not been an issue. I do like this windows OS. I'm really hoping they will s**t or get off the pot (microsoft) and dedicate themselves to developing this OS. It has that much potential. In general I hate most microsoft products, so I am really pleased even for it's shortcomings. All in all, considering the price it's really a five star phone.",0.2110347376201034

B004H23JXW,"Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)	",Samsung,Diego Vega Aguirre,Really great phone,"I have been using this phone for about two months by now. Before I bought the Samsung Focus I owned the HTC Surround, Apple's iPhone 3GS, and HTC Touch Pro. I will review not just the phone, because I think the OS is also very important when talking about a WP7 Phone. Dimensions and Characteristics the screen size is bigger than iPhone's 3G or 4G. Talking about image quality, I prefer the Focus, the image is brighter and color look awesome. This phone is really slim and light, the opposite of HTC Surround, which is much thicker and heavier because of the sliding speaker. The built in camera is good and you have a good flash light also which is nice to have when taking pictures in dark ambience, but of course, the image quality is much lower than using a digital camera. User Interface Microsoft has done a great job redesigning the screens in WP7 (now WP7.5) with ""Metro"". You will see that the icons (which are called tiles) in the main screen are ""alive"" and are not static icons like the iPhone or Android or Blackberry. The tile gives you information about your contacts or a group of contacts (updates from Windows Live, Facebook, My Space, Messenger, Twitter and LinkedIn). Now many applications are using live tiles to give you specific information so don't have to launch the app to see some important information. Also live tiles make the main screen more attractive... I like them. Zune vs. iTunes After using iTunes for several years, I just realized that if you don't have an Apple's computer, then you will have some troubles using iTunes (at least that's my experience). I have to say that I like Zune much more than I like iTunes. Zune is all about multimedia, the user interface is really nice, full of watermarks which change depending of what you are viewing and that makes you enjoy using the software, the opposite feeling when I use iTunes which I consider boring and I use it because I have to in order to synchronize my iPod. Touchscreen I think Focus' touchscreen responds better than iPhone's 3GS or 4G. The screen responds incredible fast (compared to iPhone) and touch is very accurate (much better than I got in Touch Pro... I can't even compare them!) Marketplace vs. Appstore In Ecuador the items you can purchase from Appstore is very limited due copyright terms (but Apple opened many items last week for Ecuador). In US you will find a lot of more applications in Appstore than Marketplace, even though Microsoft is doing a great job with developers, but there is a long way to go. I would really like to have applications in Marketplace like Google Maps (even though you have gMaps) and Skype (which has been announced to be delivered be the end of 2011). If you think the applications are something really important when you have to pick your phone, then I recommend that you look at Zune or Marketplace if those applications you really like are available for WP7. If the application is not in available, then you can check at developer's forums if there are any plans to develop the software, but now you can find almost every great application in WP. Keyboard If you are used to type using a built-in keyboard (like Blackberry 9300 or similar), then you will have some troubles while you get used to type on the screen. iPhone's and HTC's keyboard work pretty much the same, both respond fast and the size of the letters are good enough to type without making many mistakes. You can turn on the grammar checker that helps you to correct misspelled words (several languages now with Mango Update). Even though 99% of the time I write in Spanish, I have to say that the spell checker works great. Office Hub I expected more from WP7 Office hub. The office applications are extremely basic and I still don't know how to synchronize documents from the phone to the PC (without using Skydrive), or transfer files from the PC to the Phone. Conclusion In conclusion, I am not an expert about phones; but I have used several models and OS and I really like WP7 (which is completely different of Windows Mobile. WM was the worst OS I have used!). With Mango Update (also known as Windows Phone 7.5) you can create groups of your contacts and pin the group to the home screen. Since you can link information from Messenger, Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter of your contacts, live tiles will tell you if anyone of your contacts in the group has shared something in any of those networks and you can make any comment or share anything you want without using any app, because everything is integrated in the OS, but not everything is perfect, now I have to charge the phone twice a day, actually now I have a charger at home, at office and the car (I hope there is a way to fix this because the battery lasts some time 5 or 6 hours, if you play a game then it will last 1 hour). In the Message Hub now you can send messages not only using the regular SMS, you can send messages to your contacts in Messenger and Facebook Chat. The phone will let you know if the contact you are writing to is connected to one of those two networks (or both), otherwise it will suggest sending a regular SMS. I am really happy with this phone and I don't find any reason to go back to iPhone or change to Android. I also think this phone is better than HTC Surround due to a better screen, is lighter and has a better camera.",0.2441285968933028
B004H23JXW,"Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)	",Samsung,Alec,Surpasses Any Other Phone. All I Can Say Is Wow.,"This phone, coming from a previous Samsung phone user, is absolutely amazing. I have never had or even played with a phone this stellar. Previously I have had a blackberry, a galaxy and a gravity. There are many well created things that go along with this phone but at the same time, there are a few downsides. Here's a pros cons list to help out... Pros * Very nice screen, surpasses any other touch-screen I've used * Very easy to learn the functions included * A lot of customization options included in interface * Uses standard Micro-USB charger * Has X-Box live capabilities * A generous sized screen * Can use internet over WI-FI * Zune music and video Cons * Battery can sometimes only last for 24 hours * If on T-Mobile or other carrier besides AT&T cannot send or receive pictures * Low quality camera Another heads up would be that if you want to sign into your current X-Box live account, make sure to use the e-mail linked to that account or else it will set u up with an automatic account and you cant change it unless you proceed with a master reset :( i made that mistake when i first got the phone. Anyways overall, I would say that this phone is a 9/10 for battery use and X-Box live. I would HIGHLY recommend this phone if you are between two different ones.",0.0991636363636363

I popped in my T-Mobile SIM card and the phone was good to go. I think my phone came with a defective battery: it takes over four hours to charge. I'm looking to get that replaced. The AMOLED screen is amazing. The system is fast, responsive, and looks great. It's programmed in C#, if you're into that sort of thing :-). But I'll skip all the awesome stuff that you've already read about. Let me mention a few of the current downsides. * You must use Microsoft's Zune software to manage music. I prefer mp3 players which act like USB drives. I.e. you plug them in and your filesystem browser displays the contents as regular folders and files. This Windows Phone doesn't work this way. There is apparently some registry hack to work around this, but it would be nice if Microsoft supported this out of the box. * No sleep timer - There are a couple of free ones on the marketplace, but they aren't ideal. * No FLAC support * No OGG support * T-Mobile users: Sending pictures in texts doesn't seem to work. * T-Mobile users: Seems like the data speed is limited to 2G. I don't have a high-end data plan so I'm not so concerned about this. The Wi-Fi speeds are great of course.

Much better than the iPhone, HTC and Motorola displays. It truly is amazing and works good in all conditions including outdoors. The Samsung Captivate (android phone) also has the same screen. If fact, Samsung is now switching all their future phones to use AMOLED. SOUND: The Speaker and call quality is very good. I have used a lot of phones and I can tell you this is the best yet. The speaker phone sounds just as good as a full size home phone. Compared to my daughters new iPod, the Focus speaker is way better, and she even admitted it. SPEED: Windows Phone 7 powered by the snapdragon 1GH processor is very fast. No lag, no screen delay, no issue flicking and scrolling. Fast internet browser as well. FEATURES: I am very impressed how polished Windows Phone 7 is, and I think its going to get better. Microsoft is putting a great deal of money into it and consumers get the reward. The Windows Phone 7 live tiles are so much better than old school icons on most other phones. SUMMARY: This phone is truly ahead of its time. There are people that will say the iPhone or Android is better, but that is only bias because they probably have never used this phone and compared the features I mentioned above. I am also looking forward to the WP7 mango update that has 500+ more features. This phone is amazing. - UPDATE 11/22. Running latest windows phone 7.5 mango update. Works great. A lot more high quality apps are now available. My wife got the same phone for free at ATT with 2 year contract. For $200 samsung now has a Focus S (based on the Galaxy S 2) which I guess is the next gen for this phone. Try it!",0.4174368686868687

Windows Phone 7 great.,"I had no problems purchasing this item. The phones were speedily shipped and came fully boxed and packaged and SIM unlocked. Windows Phone 7 is a joy to use - slicker and more elegant than either Android or Blackberry phones. I like it more than Apple phones as well. The handset and the interface both feel modern and high tech and a very easy to use. And the text on the phone is big - which makes it much easier to read than any other phone. Everyone who has seen it wants one. Two things you need to know. The phone has an AT&T logo - which is a bit of a surprise when you first turn on the phone. And there is some bundled AT&T software that takes 30 seconds to uninstall. So this is more of a very minor one off solvable issue than anything. The second is that the phone operating system needs to be upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 7.5 (Mango). This requires downloading and installing Microsoft Zune on your computer, hooking your phone to your computer, and checking for upgrades. The upgrade process also takes 30-40 minutes. This is a bit of a hassle. But still worth it overall. I am very happy with this Samsung Focus phone and Windows Phone 7.",0.3046296296296296

Lets focus on the CAN DO part since there are so many more! It CAN: o Have an UNLIMITED amount of Email Accounts including military accounts. o Shoot HI DEF Video with great compression due to being a Microsoft WINDOWS 7 Operating System. o Can shoot thousands of photos before the 8GB of space fills up! o Works great with any Windows product because the same dudes designed it o Can take a beating. I've dropped mine several times, and nothing happened to it. NOTHING! o easy to work on. I've modified a few things on mine and it was SUPER easy to take apart with a video from YouTube.com o Open OFFICE Documents, and .PDFs easily without any fancy anything. o HAS N-WIFI, need I say anything else? o has the FULL version of IE 9.0.xxx internet browser, so you can go to any website! o lots of applications for sale and for free. Not as many as DROID or iPhone but catching up o High Def Screen built at the Factories in S.Korea. SAMSUNG makes most of the internal parts for Apple, Nokia, Sony, etc.. o Easy to use. So fricken easy to use! o Low Cost Smart Phone Option - Dude, got mine with an upgrade at AT&T and it cost $49.99. WOW! The iPhone was $299.99 at the time. o it can mow your lawn...OK it can't mow the lawn! But it can turn the lights, alarm system, and my car on from my bed! o SKYPE, yep, video call for free with a wifi connection. o it's 3G system, which is still fast enough to STREAM video from YouTube or wherever! o has great reception, unlike the other guys ;-) o it's light, black, and SEXY as heck :-) What it can't do: o Cook o Clean o Make Babies o wash your car o take out the trash o brush your teeth --- The only issue I have with this phone, which is minute, is the 1800mah battery. That is it, it needs the 3200mah battery factory. Otherwise it is a near perfect option for the entry level user of the Smart Phones.
